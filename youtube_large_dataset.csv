***************************************
Content marketing is the process of creating and distributing content to attract and retain customers.

You’re creating blog posts, videos, podcasts, or whatever, promoting it, and your content’s job is to lead people towards a profitable action.

If you’ve never really bought this whole idea of “content that sells,” this concept might not make a whole lot of sense or just sound cliche.

But if you think about why and how you made your last purchase that wasn’t a necessity like groceries, or clothes, content was probably involved. You probably had a problem, searched for solutions, and content from blogs, videos, and reviews led you through your entire purchasing journey. 

With so much information available at the tip of our fingers, consumers will be influenced by content. Through the power of content marketing, you can intentionally integrate your company and products within these purchasing journeys. 

Content marketing helps to creates awareness and attracts potential customers to your content, your content engages them and builds credibility for your brand, it converts visitors into customers, it allows you to build a loyal following, and for a software product like ours, it helps retain customers because they learn how to do new things with our tools leading to increased usage. 

Best of all, your revenue compounds because unlike advertising where your ads stop appearing the minute you stop paying, content that surfaces where and when your customers are searching, is consistent. 

And it’s important to note that no matter how good your content is, if your products aren’t up to scratch, then content won’t save you at least for the long haul.

The two main parts of content marketing is:
► Create content
► Distribute or promote it

You’ll learn everything you need to know about how to do those two things well in the video.

MD5-HByRxoA,1.2M Followers in 6 Months… My Content Marketing Strategy REVEALED,"Download your free scaling roadmap here: https://www.acquisition.com/roadmap-yt-d
The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/hormozi
Business owners: Want to scale faster? We provide in-person advisory for companies doing at least $1M per year: https://www.acquisition.com/workshop-yt

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

Gary Vaynerchuk is a serial entrepreneur and serves as the Chairman of VaynerX, the CEO of VaynerMedia, and the Creator & CEO of VeeFriends. Gary is considered one of the leading global minds on what's next in culture, business, and the internet.

Known as ""GaryVee,"" he is described as one of the most forward thinkers in business. He acutely recognizes trends and patterns early to help others understand how shifts in consumer attention impact the realities of the business world today. Gary's approach sits at the intersection of business and pop culture. He keenly understands how to bring brand relevance to the forefront. He is a prolific angel investor with early investments in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, Coinbase, and Uber.

This year, Gary unveiled his seventh book, ""Day Trading Attention"" where he provides fresh insights into navigating the modern social media landscape. Gary's expertise guides readers on harnessing underpriced attention channels in the digital age. He emphasizes mastering storytelling in these arenas and highlights the ""TikTokification of Social Media,"" where content relevance surpasses follower counts. Businesses can leverage this shift to enhance their brand and boost sales. ""Day Trading Attention"" equips readers with essential skills to succeed in today's dynamic digital world. Gary also announced his first children's picture book, based on his VeeFriends characters, titled ""Meet Me in the Middle”. The picture book, which will prominently feature two VeeFriends characters, Eager Eagle and Patient Pig, delves into the emotional elements essential for nurturing children's empathy – a crucial skill for their future success.

Gary is an entrepreneur at heart – he builds businesses. Today, he helps Fortune 1000 brands leverage consumer attention through his full-service advertising agency, VaynerMedia, which has offices in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur. VaynerMedia is part of the VaynerX holding company, which also includes Eva Nosidam Productions, Gallery Media Group, The Sasha Group, VaynerSpeakers, VaynerCommerce, and Tingley Lane Trading. Gary is the Co-Founder of VaynerSports, VCR Group, VaynerWatt, ArtOfficial, Resy, and Empathy Wines. He guided Resy and Empathy to successful exits -- which he later sold to American Express and Constellation Brands, respectively. He also owns a Major League Pickleball team called the 5s, is part owner of a Big3 basketball team, and is an investor in the revival of the SlamBall League.

Gary is also the founder and creator of VeeCon – a contemporary super conference that converges business and pop culture with innovation and technology. In addition to running multiple businesses, Gary documents his daily life as a CEO through his social media channels, which have more than 44 million followers and garner over 300 million monthly impressions/views across all platforms. His podcast, ""The GaryVee Audio Experience,"" ranks among the top podcasts globally.

Gary serves on the board of MikMak, Bojangles Restaurants, Global Citizen Forum, and Pencils of Promise. He is also a longtime Well Member of charity: water.

B0nYJp2F7CA,What is Content Marketing?,"In this video, Jen (a content marketer, herself) explains what content marketing is, why you should invest in it for your business, and what you can expect from good content.  

Content marketing is a digital marketing strategy that uses assets like videos, blog posts, articles, images, and graphics to engage your audience and build relationships online. The ultimate goal is to strengthen the trust between you and your audience so that they come to you when they're looking for information or to purchase something you offer. 

You should create content for each stage of the customer journey. People are searching for different information at each stage of the buying process, and having that information ready can help you stand out among your competitors. You want your content to answer questions, solve problems, and give advice that helps people make decisions. More on this in the video.

A great digital marketing strategy includes content that's tailored to your audience and full of helpful information.

Compelling content is a cornerstone of any modern marketing strategy. More than 50% of businesses currently invest money, time, and energy into content marketing, with most of them publishing new material every. single. day. 

With so much content out there and demand for new, engaging content growing, it can be hard for someone marketing a small business, running a blog, or helping out clients to know where to begin. Well, this video is going to show you exactly where to start.

A great place to start when building a content plan is by taking a look at the competition. Understanding which keywords your competitors are focusing on can clue you in to areas you may be lacking content, and missing out on capturing your potential customers.

The first Semrush tool you're going to use is our Keyword Gap Tool. 
A great tool that compares your site with your competitors’ and shows keywords that you share, and most importantly, ones that you are missing. Now, this tool will actually suggest competitor’s here that you can compare your site to. So, even if you don’t have an exact idea of who to compare yourself to, the tool takes care of that for you.

Clicking on a keyword is going to take us to the Keyword Overview tool. This tool shows helpful stats about that particular keyword, such as search volume and difficulty score. The Questions section can provide very useful insights into the questions people are asking about your keyword. Understanding what information people are searching for, what questions they want answered, can guide your content writing. Your content should provide valuable information to people asking these questions. Add these keywords to your keyword list.

Clicking on the name of your keyword list is going to bring you directly to the Keyword Manager Tool, where all of the keywords are compiled, along with key metrics. 

By following these steps you should be able to easily create a content plan, and even create some of the content.

This video will break down some content marketing tips to scale your content strategy without a big budget or taking up valuable time you can spend running your business. Content strategies you can use include: repurposing your high-performing content, leveraging UGC and collaborations, outsourcing creation to an agency, and one of the biggest time-savers is using automation tools to help create and schedule things easily and efficiently. 

These are all ways to deliver more relevant content, higher quality content, and also using 3rd parties to put out more content and build trust with your audience. One of the most important things small business content strategies can focus on is creating quality content over quality. In the AI age we're in, you might feel like you need to create more content to keep up, but high-quality content is perfect for businesses looking to get more out of their time.

____________________________________________

Do you want more traffic through content marketing, do you want higher rankings on Google, do you want more social traffic? Define what you're looking for, so that way you can keep that in mind throughout the whole course. 

Now, anytime you do a Google search, you'll notice that the content is in the middle of the results. At the top tends to be ads or product ads or any type of ads. There is also, in some cases, local listing ads. But in the middle is organic SEO results. This is what you don't have to pay for. These results are typically earned through content or content marketing.

The benefits of content marketing, you're going to get a ton of value in goodwill to people, and by doing that, you're going to build a much more loyal brand, you're going to have people coming back, you're going to build that virality, that word of mouth, it's going to help you increase your organic traffic on Google, it's going to help you increase your social media traffic, it may even cause speaking engagements, like I've gotten book deals, investment opportunities, people coming to you trying to invest in you, you'll also of course get leads and more sales as well. If you want to do well, you got to think about what Google wants. 

Google wants high quality content that people love, that's what they want to rank. They don't want to rank it because this is what Google has deemed important, they want to rank that type of content because Google has deemed that that's what people want. 

Remember, Google adjust their algorithm to what people want, what their searchers want. And their searchers want high quality content that people love and can take action on. Now, during this course, you're going to end up learning a lot. It's broken down into four modules, one module per week. I'm going to teach you everything on, hey, what is content marketing, how does it work? To how to create content, to how to market it, how to leverage all those channels out there, how to repurpose your content, and much, much more.

The big part that people mistake when it comes to content marketing is just not about creating content, you also have to do the marketing as well. It's the only way that you're going to get loved by Google. 

The program structure, you already know, it's over four weeks, three lessons a week. You're going to be implementing your learnings each week. If you put in the time, you will get results. The assignments, the worksheets, the cheat sheets, assessments, whatever you want to call them, they don't take too long. You can typically fill them out and do a lot of them within 15, 20 minutes. 

And when you're going throughout the whole content marketing unlocked course, take your time with the videos, pause where you need to, re-watch if you have to as well, because if you do things right, you can get amazing results. 

So some action items for you, go do the goals worksheet, and the second one is download the course itinerary so you can get a real good overview of what you're going to learn over the next four weeks. And you can get this all at neilpatel.com/training, click on content marketing unlocked. 

By the end of the course, you'll be able to know how to build shareworthy content, and on top of that, get that traffic to that content so people can see it and convert that traffic into leads or sales, so that way you're generating revenue. 

The key to content marketing is to make sure you're consistent. If you're consistent over the long run, you are going to be successful. I look forward to helping you grow your traffic through content marketing.

UTbAocmK5E0,Don't Do This: Why Some Companies Suck at Content Marketing,"Most companies don’t do content marketing very well. Why is that? In my experience in working with companies the number one reason they fail at content marketing is they don’t have the patience or the stamina to build an audience. They expect an immediate ROI. Content marketing doesn’t work that way. Growing a devoted and faithful audience by delivering real value through content takes time - sometimes a lot of time. But, once you do build it, the rewards can be overwhelmingly positive and lucrative.

See in 2019 content won't rank as well as it used to. Yes they say content is king, but you already know there's over a billion blogs. Nowadays Google isn't just picking from, hey what content do we wanna rank, 'cause we lack content. They're like, we have content on everything under the sun, and the same thing a hundred other times. So now they're just not picking, what content do we wanna rank? They're looking at authority, user metrics, they're even looking at when was the content created. Why would they wanna rank a content that's two years old, when they can rank something that's less than one week old. So when it comes to content marketing in 2019, you need to make sure that your content's also being up to date. If you don't update your old content, you're not going to get as much love as people who're continually pushing out new fresh content.

Second tip I have for you is don't regurgitate the same information over and over again. People are tired of reading 12 SEO tips that'll double your traffic. You can google it, there's probably different variations of that number, but there's probably hundreds of articles on that subject. Write something new, fresh, that hasn't been seen before, you're more likely to get traffic, rankings, and even social shares.

I know you're not gonna like this third tip, but the third tip for you guys is to create video and audio based content. Text is overrated, it doesn't help you connect with people as much as video. I still love text, I still crank out text, but the future is video. It's much more personable, people get to know you, your personality, your company better. So create video based content, upload it to YouTube, Linkedin, heck you can even do Twitter and Instagram if it's short enough, and of course Facebook. Don't share the same video over and over again, like sharing your YouTube video on Facebook. You gotta take that video all over again, and reupload it into Facebook. Linkedin for example, you gotta reupload the video all over again versus sharing the link to that Facebook video. Or that YouTube video. Now with audio you wanna create a podcast, it's easy, you can just bust out your phone, create a audio file, upload it to Itunes or Lip Sync, and you're off and to the races. Same with video, you don't actually have to go into a studio like I am, and shoot all these fancy videos and pay money. You can just bust out your phone. I would even say most the time, from all the tests we've ran, the videos that you end up running on your iPhone convert better if you're selling a product or service. So there's nothing wrong with doing that. Just look at Tai Lopez, he's known for just busting out his phone, and recording videos and it does very well for him.

And the last tip I have for you is promoting your content. In 2019 you gotta spend more time promoting than writing.

Content strategies you can use include: repurposing your high-performing content, leveraging UGC and collaborations, outsourcing creation to an agency, and one of the biggest time-savers is using automation tools to help create and schedule things easily and efficiently. 

These are all ways to deliver more relevant content, higher quality content, and also using 3rd parties to put out more content and build trust with your audience. One of the most important things small business content strategies can focus on is creating quality content over quality.

XBhO4jC0ntw,Content marketing là gì? Nghề content marketing là gì?,"Content Marketing là gì?
Content Marketing là hình thức tiếp thị tập trung vào việc tạo ra và phân phối nội dung có giá trị, phù hợp và nhất quán nhằm thu hút và giữ chân đối tượng khách hàng mục tiêu – từ đó thúc đẩy hành vi mua hàng và xây dựng lòng trung thành với thương hiệu.

Khác với quảng cáo truyền thống vốn thiên về “bán hàng ngay lập tức”, content marketing tập trung vào giá trị lâu dài, giúp khách hàng giải quyết vấn đề, hiểu rõ sản phẩm, và hình thành niềm tin trước khi họ đưa ra quyết định mua hàng.

Ví dụ điển hình của Content Marketing:
Blog chia sẻ kiến thức chuyên sâu (như HubSpot, Ahrefs)
Video hướng dẫn, review sản phẩm (như Tiki, Shopee)
Ebook miễn phí về cách giải quyết vấn đề cụ thể
Infographic cung cấp thông tin cô đọng, dễ hiểu

How to create your content marketing strategy

What is content marketing?

The purpose of content marketing is to drive both inbound customer engagement and organic searches (using search engine optimization, or SEO) from a defined audience, which can then be nurtured to convert into valuable customers. Content is strategically created or curated, and distributed in key locations across the internet to attract customers to your website. 

What is Inbound marketing?

But what exactly is inbound marketing? Well, it’s a strategy where brands use content marketing to attract customers. The key driver of inbound marketing is consumer intent as potential customers actively seek out the brand’s content. As a result, consumers are more engaged and open to taking action than if the brand were to communicate with them when they are not actively interested. 

What is Outbound Marketing?

Outbound marketing, on the other hand, is when the brand pushes its messages out to as many people as it can within a target audience. The brand believes that this audience is a good match for the product or service being advertised. Of course, consumers might not be interested in the product at that particular time! So outbound advertising is generally less effective than inbound marketing at driving action.

Video Transcript:
Content marketing is a powerful way to reach your audience, but it can also be really confusing to figure out what content you should use and when you should use it. 

One of the first things that I had to iron out as I became a practitioner of content marketing is to realize that content is just a tool. Uh, content is king, is kind of a, a non-issue saying because it's kind of like saying tools are king or cars are king. 

There are different types of tools, there are different types of cars and trucks for different purposes, and the same thing goes with content marketing. 

Content is the fuel of any marketing strategy because this is how your message and speak to and speak with your audience and push them towards a sale one way or the other, or a conversion.

But which type of content should you use? You have limited time and resources so you need to know what kind of content to focus on, depending on your audience, and that's really what we're going to go over today. 

And this is important because great content takes a lot of time and energy to create and you don't want to waste either one.

So there are different types of content to think about, and one of the first things that you need to consider are, is, what are your business goals? 

You need to think about the needs of your customers when choosing the type of content but also overlay that with your goals because your company is putting out the content, so you need to make sure that the content is getting conversions, having people sign up, making sales.

A winning content strategy has five things in common, who, what, where, when, and how. Who are your customers and what do they look like? What's their age, gender, location, demographic? These kinds of features tell who your audience is composed of. 

So you need to know what their pain points are and the solutions are you providing. These are really basic business points but they also carry over to content marketing and different types of content for your business.

Where do your customers look for answers and solutions? Do they look to Google, are they're on Reddit, do they go to YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn? 

This is important because every channel that you work with will require different types of content to really reach your core audience. Where are your customers or when are they ready to buy? Where are they in the customer journey? 

This is important because different types of content, and we'll go into this more in detail, different types of content need to be used at different points of the customer journey. 

And how do your customers search for answers and solutions online? Do they use a laptop or a phone, are they looking for a restaurant as they're driving? Hopefully in the passenger seat. 

Or are they looking for a hotel right when they get off a plane? 

This is also a vital piece because we have to know how people consume our content to know if we need to optimize that for mobile or if we need to m- optimize it for laptops or Bing or Google, whatever that might be.

And then the third piece is the customer journey. Uh, the customer journey comprises of mainly three different segments, awareness, consideration and decision. 

Each one of these is o- one part of a relationship. And within that relationship, you can use content in different points to foster, uh, you know, moving on to the next stage. 

So with that said, what we're gonna do is, is go over, in the next couple of videos, the eight different types of content that I consider important for any content strategy. 

Those are blogging, social media posts, infographics, video content, eBooks, white paper, paid search and case studies/ testimonials. 

So stay tuned as we go in and we answer those questions about when should you use different types of content, how much does it cost, how much does it take",StrategyBeam- Digital Strategy & Online Marketing,2021-06-16T20:56:45Z,208,1,1,content marketing

04:46 Summary and conclusion 

First of all, what is a content marketing strategy? 
A content marketing strategy is a game plan to reach your target audience through content crafted to meet their needs and likes. Imagine it as a menu card with various items such as blogs, ebooks, videos and social media, tailored for different audiences with different tastes at different parts of the customer journey. 

How to make a marketing and content strategy? 

Tip 1: Define clear goals 🎯 
A well-defined and effective content strategy starts with a clear goal. What does your brand wish to achieve with your content? Are you aiming to boost leads, increase website traffic, build a community or increase awareness for your brand? Defining your goals and documenting them on paper is the first step for success. 

Tip 2: Understand your target audience 🔍 
What drives your target audience? What information would help them in their decision-making process, what problems do they face and where do they consume content? When you know the answer to these questions you will be able to create content that resonates with them. 

Tip 3: Brainstorm ideas 🧠 
A successful content strategy will have content tailored to various stages of the customer journey while employing content types that work for your audience such as blogs, videos, social media posts, podcasts, infographics etc. By brainstorming with teams for ideas you will be increasing your chances of coming out with creative content that stands out from the crowd. 

Tip 4: Create meaningful content 🚀 
If you create content without stopping to think whether it appeals to your end users and potential customers then you are fighting a losing battle. Aim to create content that adds value to your target audience’s lives and do so by planning in advance. Employ tools such as a content calendar to bring structure to your content creation efforts.  

Tip 5: Amplify, optimize, promote 🌐 
To help your content achieve its full potential, plan a distribution and promotion calendar. Employ various marketing channels at your disposal such as social media, email marketing and internal and external newsletters, to increase your content reach. Also, SEO optimize before publishing the content. 

Tip 6: Analyze and improve to succeed 📈 
Data, data, data. Harness the power of data and analytics to see what is performing and what is not to finetune your content strategy. Continuous improvement is the recipe for success.

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

HAGQ9YDrfiw,Content marketing for small business owners,"Marketing won't solve all your business problems. And I'm tired of pretending it will. 🫠

Story time: In college, I worked with a logistics company trying to break into the Mexican market. My group created this gorgeous, comprehensive marketing strategy that should've gotten us an A+.

Then we threw the whole thing away.

Why? 

Because they had ZERO Spanish-language materials. 

❌ No bilingual salespeople. 
❌ No Spanish customer service. 

They wanted to market to Spanish-speaking customers... in English only. 🙃

No amount of brilliant marketing was going to fix that fundamental business issue.

Fast forward to today, and I see small business owners making similar mistakes:

→ Thinking more content will fix a pricing problem

→ Blaming ""low engagement"" when they're talking to the wrong audience

→ Creating endless posts when their offer isn't even clear

Your ""content isn't working"" problem might not be a content problem at all.

Before you create another post, ask yourself… 

Is this actually a marketing issue, or is there something deeper in my business that needs attention first?

Because sometimes the best marketing strategy is fixing your business operations before you try to market them.",Amber Figlow,2025-08-25T20:03:58Z,706,26,1,content marketing

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

No matter what kind of digital marketing you engage in, you’re going to need great content. Great content doesn’t involve plugging your products endlessly. Instead, it offers real value to people – and most importantly, it serves a purpose.

When you have great content, your customers will look forward to receiving it – whether that’s via a new video uploaded to your website, a funny email, or an informative blog post. They will want to spend time with it and share it with their friends. This positive sentiment, in turn, can be great for your bottom line, as it usually leads to better customers who are loyal to your brand. 

So it makes sense to ensure that content marketing is at the heart of all your marketing tactics. Let’s dive straight into the world of content marketing and what it can do for your business.

LDa2SOORxoY,Content in Crisis: How Content Marketing Became So Unsustainable (and What We Can Do to Fix It),"All of a sudden, content marketing feels like the wild, wild west. 

Tactics and channels that worked yesterday are failing today. You find yourself chasing algorithms, scaling volume, and publishing “random acts of content.” But you know it’s a losing game in the AI era.

This feeling isn’t just in your head. 

It’s nearly universal across content leaders at companies big and small.

Our latest survey of 50+ content leaders confirms that this critical content crossroads is leaving teams feeling adrift and powerless.

So how do we get through this crisis—without stepping right into the next one?

In this live webinar, we’ll help you escape this treadmill of uncertainty and architect a sustainable, strategic plan for the new future of content.",Optimist - Growth-Focused Content Marketing Agency,2025-10-24T08:03:24Z,39,2,0,content marketing

Was ist Content Marketing?  

Content bedeutet übersetzt Inhalt und kann unterhaltend, informierend oder beratend sein. Im Bezug aufs Marketing ist Content zum Beispiel ein Bild oder Video in einem Sozialen Kanal wie TikTok oder YouTube. Marketing ist die Ausrichtung eines Unternehmens am Markt mit dem Ziel durch unterschiedliche Strategien für steigende Absatzzahlen zu sorgen. 

Content Marketing bezeichnet also die Social Media Kommunikation im Online Marketing. Hier wird eine Zielgruppe durch verschiedene Inhalte angesprochen und im besten Fall Neukunden gewonnen und langfristig gebunden. 

 
Content Marketing am Beispiel TikTok 

Basti erklärt am Beispiel TikTok wie man beim Content Marketing vorgeht und worauf man auch bei der Auswahl der Social Media Kanäle achten sollte. Vor allem um auf sich als Unternehmen aufmerksam zu machen und unterschwellig eine Bindung aufzubauen, eignet sich TikTok als Marketingkanal gut. 

 
Wie kann ich Content Marketing effektiv in meiner Marketing Strategie nutzen? 

Die passende Content Martketing Strategie ist für jedes Unternehmen und seine Zielgruppe individuell. Herausgefunden wird sie, in dem Unternehmen ihre Zielgruppe genaustens kennen. Auch die Wahl der Medien spielt da eine Rolle. Dabei helfen vor allem auch die W-Fragen. 

Was? Welcher Inhalt soll verbreitet werden? 
Wie? Wie möchte ich meine Inhalte platzieren? 
Wer? Wer ist meine Zielgruppe? 
Wo? Auf welchem Kanal?

The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/hormozi
Business owners: Want to scale faster? We provide in-person advisory for companies doing at least $1M per year: https://www.acquisition.com/workshop-yt

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

4ZXhAe7bBHc,Content Marketing in 3 Minuten erklärt,"Content Marketing gewinnt im Marketing zunehmend an Bedeutung. Doch was ist das eigentlich und wie lässt es sich im Unternehmen einsetzen? Das erklären wir euch in diesem handmade Erklärfilm.

„Niemand außer dir interessiert sich für deine Produkte. Erstelle interessante Inhalte!“ 

So provokativ aber auch prägnant bringt der Marketing-Stratege David Meermann Scott eine wichtige Marketing Überlegung auf den Punkt: das Content Marketing.
Beim content marketing stehen Inhalte im Zentrum. Produkt oder Marke rücken bewusst in den Hintergrund. Die Inhalte sind informierend, beratend oder auch unterhaltend. Know-how, Werteversprechen und Produktvorteile werden also nicht einfach nur behauptet – sondern durch den Inhalt veranschaulicht.
Aber warum ist das für Sie als Unternehmer wichtig? 
Vor allem emotionale Inhalte und Unternehmenswerte, wie zum Beispiel Nachhaltigkeit oder soziales Handeln, werden mit content marketing gut transportiert. Denn damit sind diese Werte nicht nur leere Worthülsen, sondern Sie können dem Kunden zeigen, wie Sie die Werte in Ihrem Unternehmen konkret umsetzen. So beeinflussen Sie auch die Wahrnehmung Ihres Unternehmens. 
Kunden suchen nicht nach Produkten, sondern nach Lösungen und glaubwürdigen Antworten. Inhalte die auf dieses Bedürfnis eingehen, bekommen also mehr Aufmerksamkeit. Im Internet bedeutet das auch eine bessere Platzierung bei Suchmaschinen. Außerdem wird der Traffic auf Ihrer Website erhöht und Sie generieren mehr Leads. 
Um diese Vorteile zu erreichen, muss content marketing aber auch richtig eingesetzt werden: Die Informationen sollen die Lösung eines Problems aufzeigen, praktisch anwendbares Know-How vermitteln oder Spezialwissen für Fachleute kommunizieren. Content marketing ist also auch für den B2B‑Bereich wichtig. Die Formen der Umsetzung sind vielfältig: Blogposts, Whitepapers, Infografiken, Videos oder Facebook posts.eignen sich besonders gut. 
Wie gutes content marketing funktioniert zeigt zum Beispiel der Kosmetikhersteller Schwarzkopf mit seinem Internetauftritt. Hier stehen die Infos im Vordergrund! Die Seite wirkt wie eine Frauenzeitschrift, bietet inhaltlichen Mehrwert und gibt praktische Tipps. Die Produkte werden nur dezent plaziert. Ähnlich ist es bei Betty Bossi. Sie teilt Ihre Kochrezepte nicht nur im Internet, sondern auch in Kochbüchern und einer Zeitschrift. Ursprünglich wurde mit Betty Bossi für die vermehrte Verwendung von Margarine und Öl geworben. Heute dient diese Form des content marketing auch dazu, Produkte von Coop zu bewerben.

Denken Sie also daran: Erstellen Sie aussagekräftige Inhalte, dann kommt das Interesse an Ihren Produkten von ganz allein.",youknow,2018-02-02T14:33:36Z,41609,422,8,content marketing

En français, on dit : ""Pour attirer l'attention, il faut raconter des histoires intéressantes dans les contenus qu'on partage.""
Explication complète : Le storytelling est l'art de raconter une histoire qui capte l'attention et crée une connexion émotionnelle avec le public. En marketing, cela peut être une anecdote sur la création de l'entreprise, une mise en scène d'un client satisfait ou une présentation des coulisses.

li23hMplE6E,Big Reason Why Your Content Marketing Fails,"Ladies and Gentlemen, it’s time to get electrified! 🔥💡 Are you ready to learn the secrets of how the mastermind behind AC electricity, Nikola Tesla, would’ve rocked the marketing world? 🤔
We just stumbled upon a video that’s about to blow your mind! 🤯 It’s the ultimate mashup of Tesla, electricity, and advertising. And trust us, if Tesla were around today, he’d be the king of breakthrough advertising! 🤣

Imagine a Tesla commercial that’s so catchy, you’ll be humming the jingle all day long! 🎶 A dance routine so electrifying, it’ll make you want to break out into the robot! 🕺 And a hashtag that’s hotter than a lightning bolt! 🔥

But don’t just take our word for it, watch the video and see for yourself! You’ll learn how Tesla’s innovative ideas and techniques changed the game and how his legacy still lives on today. 💡 And who knows, you might just pick up a trick or two on how to create a marketing campaign that’ll leave your competitors in the dust! 💨

So sit back, grab some popcorn, and get ready for a humorous take on Tesla, electricity, and advertising! And remember, if you’re not marketing like Tesla, you’re missing out on a shock of a good time! 🔥💡

L40fJMg6gvg,Net New Value Content #seo #content #marketing,"Creating a bunch of “what is” articles that say what’s been said a hundred times already is a waste of resources. What you should do instead is create net new value content. Let me explain.

I was talking to Margarita Loktionova (Content Marketing Lead @ Semrush) on a new #MastersOfSearch episode, and she introduced this concept of “net new value content.”

Her definition: Content that AI cannot easily synthesize from what’s already online.

This includes proprietary data, customer research, thought leadership, unique points of view. Basically, the content you need to be seen as an authoritative source for AI to reference and cite, but also for people to share and talk about.

_____________________

So here’s my practical framework for actually creating net new value content:

1) Tap into internal proprietary data

Think about what data sources you have internally that others don’t have access to.

A great example I’ve seen recently is Ramp, the US-based spend management company. They analyzed their corporate card transaction data to prove that San Francisco tech workers are actually working Saturdays now (the whole 996 schedule trend).

They looked at employee transactions for restaurants, delivery, and takeout by hour of the week. Compared 2025 to 2024. Found a pronounced jump in Saturday activity that wasn’t there before.

This is data only Ramp has. Nobody else can create this analysis. It got shared everywhere.

2) Create research through external surveys

If you don’t have unique internal data, you can create it by surveying your industry.

A great example I’ve seen for this is from Paddy Moogan (The New Leader), and Rand Fishkin (SparkToro). Paddy surveyed 600+ agency owners about revenue growth, sales pipelines, remote work trends, and AI impact.

They didn’t have this data sitting in a database. They went out and collected it. The result? One of the most comprehensive reports on the state of digital agencies.

_____________________

Once you have these insights, here’s the multiplier effect:

You can create multiple formats from one research piece.

→ Series of blog posts
→ Social posts with takeaways
→ Interviews with people who participated

***************************************
I’ve been in the digital marketing industry for well over a decade. And while I’ve had my fair share of successes, I’ve had significantly more failures. Based on my experiences, this video will walk you through how to start a career in digital marketing successfully.

Here are a few things you may want to consider the following:

► Choosing one specific area of digital marketing to focus on
► Absorb as much knowledge as you can
► Implement what you've learned into actual practice

uOazc-T8-h8,Day 8🔥How to generate leads for your Digital Marketing Agency through #facebookads #leadgeneration 💯,"This is Day 8 Of Learning Facebook Ads from scratch

If you are also an agency owner, and want to generate leads through ads, this strategy is something tried and tested.

What I Did?

Created three different video ads for a funnel

➡️ First ad was purely informational

➡️ Second one showed the results of different business and I gave free consultation at this stage

➡️ Third ad was direct service pitching

In ads manager, I focused on engagement ads and people interested in ad, can directly connect on WhatsApp.

The strategy might take sometime to come in action also make sure to keep a descent budget in the first two ads for this method to work better

Also I will share the results on my story soon as the ads are published fresh with not much data to show right now 🙌🏻

Publicity: If the elephant enters a politician’s garden and the story gets covered in the news.

Public Relations (PR): If the politician laughs about it, creating a positive image.

====================

The digital marketing landscape is undergoing a seismic shift — and the brands dominating in 2026 will be those mastering three critical pillars: traditional search, AI Search, and brand experience.

While Google maintains its dominance with 98 billion monthly visitors and over 90% market share, smart marketers are already positioning themselves for the rapidly approaching AI-powered future.

In this video, I reveal:

• The ""topic-first SEO"" strategy that generated a 288% revenue increase for Golf Course Lawn Store — and why keyword-only approaches are leaving money on the table

• How we transformed The Ordinary's blog from a brand-led resource into a revenue machine, driving 451% more revenue and 5.5x traffic in just five months

• Why Hargreaves Lansdown (UK's market leader) is invisible in AI search results while our client ZUGU dominates — and the exact playbook we used to achieve this

• The emergence of ""agentic AI commerce"" and why businesses need structured product data, real-time inventory feeds, and the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP) by 2026

• How DSLD Mortgage generated 11,410 qualified leads in 12 months using our Brand and Positioning Accelerator framework

• Why 287% more customers purchase when brands use three or more channels — and how to create consistency across all touchpoints

I'll share the exact frameworks we're using at Exposure Ninja, including how we're helping clients appear in AI Overviews, ChatGPT recommendations, and Perplexity results.

If you're planning your digital marketing strategy for 2026 and want to stay ahead of competitors still stuck in 2020's playbook, this episode provides your complete roadmap for dominating both traditional and AI-powered search channels.

CMs2QGJC_ts,Digital Marketing is Officially Dead | Case Study | Sahil Khanna,"Are digital marketing agencies becoming obsolete? In this video, we dive deep into how giants like Meta and Google are fundamentally changing the advertising landscape with AI. Traditional digital marketing, especially manual targeting, is fading away, making way for sophisticated algorithms that know your customers better than you do.

We explore the shift from manual control to automated systems like Meta's Advantage+ and Google's Performance Max. Is there a future for digital marketers when AI can create ad creatives, predict consumer reactions using neuroscience, and optimize campaigns automatically? The answer is YES, but your role is about to change dramatically.

Discover the essential skills you need to not just survive, but thrive in this new era. It's no longer just about technical skills; it's about strategy, human understanding, and leveraging AI as your most powerful tool.

4P2XHPrJ3hQ,Digital Marketing in Kenya: Why We’re Still Bargaining Over Value,"Digital Marketing in Kenya: Why We’re Still Bargaining Over Value

Let’s talk about something frustrating.

I pitched SEO services to a Kenyan business.
Explained how if someone searches for their product or service, they could appear on Google, get traffic, and grow their business.

Their first reaction?

“Eh, hiyo bei iko juu... unaweza reduce kidogo?”

Five thousand shillings.
And we’re already in the tupunguzie zone.

Now here’s the twist.

I pitched the exact same thing — same words, same process — to a Muzungu client.
Not once did they ask, “Why does it cost that much?”
They didn’t even blink. Because they understand one thing Kenyan businesses are still struggling with:

Digital marketing is not an expense. It’s growth fuel.

I have a rule in my agency:
I don’t negotiate on price. I negotiate on service.
You want a value add? I’ll throw in an extra post, a report, or some analytics.
But I won’t lower the cost. Ever.

Why? Because once you start devaluing your work, clients start devaluing you.

Digital marketing is not just about logos and pretty captions.
It’s about visibility, trust, and conversions.
If you don’t see that — you’re not ready for the game.
And the clients who get it? They’re already playing internationally.

Dear Kenyan businesses:
If you keep asking for 3K work, you’ll keep getting 300-shilling results.

4OUW20Usi30,The Psychology of People Who Don’t Post on Social Media,"The Psychology of People Who Don’t Post on Social Media

We live in a world obsessed with sharing, yet some people remain completely invisible online. They scroll quietly, observe deeply, and never post. Why do they choose silence when the whole world is shouting for attention? This video dives deep into the fascinating psychology behind 'ghost scrollers' and non-posters. It's not just about being shy; it’s about control, emotional independence, and a quiet rebellion against a culture that equates visibility with value. We explore the concepts of psychological ownership, internal locus of control, and the hidden peace found when you detach your worth from digital applause. If you've ever felt burnt out by the performance of social media, or wondered about the power of being unseen, this analysis is for you. Discover why sometimes, the most profound things happen quietly, and how non-posters might just be guarding their authenticity in a staged world.",Kee,2025-10-15T19:35:23Z,3127245,108986,9249,social media

Czg_9C7gw0o,Is Social Media Hurting Your Mental Health? | Bailey Parnell | TEDxRyersonU,"Scrolling through our social media feeds feels like a harmless part of our daily lives. But is it actually as harmless at seems? According to social media expert Bailey Parnell, our growing and unchecked obsession with social media has unintended long term consequences on our mental health. As social media continues to become part of the fabric of modern life – the “digital layer” – abstinence is becoming less of an option. Bailey think it’s high time we learned to practice safe social before it’s too late. What are the common triggers? How are they affecting you over time? How can you create a more positive experience online? Bailey covers this and more in “Is Social Media Hurting Your Mental Health?”  

Bailey Parnell was recently named one of Canada's Top 100 Most Powerful Women. She is an award-winning digital marketer, public speaker and businesswoman with a talent for helping people tell better stories. Her work and expertise have been featured on CBC, CTV & in other local Toronto media. Bailey recently founded SkillsCamp, a soft skills training company where they help people develop the essential skills needed for professional success. She also currently works in digital marketing at Ryerson University. 

Bailey is a frequent public speaker having spoken to more than 10 thousand people. She primarily speaks about social media, personal branding, and media and mental health. She guest lectured her first MBA class at 21-years-old and has been the youngest speaker as multiple academic conferences. She is currently pursuing her Masters in Communication and Culture with a research focus on social media and mental health, and holds an honours BA from the RTA School of Media at Ryerson.

3E7hkPZ-HTk,Quit social media | Dr. Cal Newport | TEDxTysons,"'Deep work' will make you better at what you do. You will achieve more in less time. And feel the sense of true fulfillment that comes from the mastery of a skill.

Cal Newport is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Georgetown University. In addition to studying the theoretical foundations of our digital age, Newport also writes about the impact of these technologies on the world of work.  His most recent book, Deep Work, argues that focus is the new I.Q. in the modern workplace and that the ability to concentrate without distraction is becoming increasingly valuable. He previously wrote So Good They Can’t Ignore You, a book which debunks the long-held belief that “follow your passion” is good advice, and three popular books of unconventional advice for students.

rDM8VzposOE,Why I Quit Social Media & How it Changed My Life (Already),"In this video, I talk about my journey of quitting social media and the surprising freedom that came with it. I grew up without social media, but once I got into it, I found myself constantly living for other people’s approval instead of focusing on my own life. The frustration of low engagement on Instagram, the pressure to keep up, and the endless comparisons left me feeling anxious, depressed, and disconnected from my own reality.
But after just a few days without the constant noise of social media, I gained so much mental clarity and space. I’ve learned to appreciate my life more and live in the moment, rather than in the lives of others. This video is all about how stepping away from social media has helped me rediscover gratitude and peace.

If you’ve ever felt trapped by the need for likes and followers, or just want to learn how to be more present, this video is for you.

cgjnDc6Naac,If You Could Live a Life Without Social Media...,"From 2016 to 2021, I've always had Social Media and felt like it was mandatory or else I would miss out on my friends, others, and everything that was happening across the world. However, I could slowly feel myself scrolling my life away, while having my time, energy, and mental health being zapped away. 
So, what if there was the chance, to live a life completely free and away from Social Media?

bN4MNdCAnWA,Why did our friends stop posting on social media? | BBC Global,"After two decades of sharing more online, it looks like more people are deciding to share less.

New polling shows that nearly a third of all social media users post less than they did a year ago.

That trend is especially true for adults in Gen Z. 

BBC Special Correspondent Katty Kay and writer Kyle Chayka discuss the ways that social media is changing – and what that means for how we live our lives online.

TR9reUOzTiQ,How Social Media Slowly Ruins Society & What You Can Do,"The war for attention isn’t just about distraction—it’s about control. It’s a battle to influence how you think, what you value, and how you act.

And if we don’t wake up to what’s happening, we risk losing the most important thing we have: our ability to think for ourselves.

The ability to direct your attention—to consciously choose what you consume and how you engage—is the most powerful skill you possess.

So if you’ve reduced “brain rot” down to being a social media problem, concluding that we should just reduce our screen time to improve our mental health, then I have bad news for you…

You’ve only scratched the surface.

This is the war of our time. And it’s time we fight back.

In this video I discuss discuss the silent epidemic which plagues the modern world: brain rot.

Defined as Oxford’s word of the year in 2024, brain rot is the deterioration of a person’s mental or intellectual state, especially as a result of overconsumption of material considered to be trivial or unchallenging.

0EFHbruKEmw,Are You Living an Insta Lie? Social Media Vs. Reality,"If you're guilty of living an Insta Lie or know somebody that is, then this video is most certainly for you. We're partnering up with boohoo.com to call out some of the funniest and most common Insta Lie's posted on social media.

Insta Lie (verb): an intentionally false representation of real-life on social media. Examples include:

1.) Tagging an edited and made-up selfie with #IWokeUpLikeThis;
2.) Taking a million selfies before deciding on just one to post as #Effortless 😕;
3.) Going all the way to Starbucks, buying a coffee and opening up your Macbook - taking a photo of your #WorkSpace, closing your Macbook and then going back home;
4.) Using filters to edit your travel photos - making them literally look #Unreal.

e6epTapkrH8,The Psychology of People Who Don’t Post on Social Media | Elon Musk,"In a world where everyone is encouraged to share everything, there exists a quiet group of people who choose the opposite. They don't post their vacations, their meals, or their achievements—not because they're hiding, but because they've discovered something most of us overlook. This video explores the fascinating psychology behind people who rarely share on social media and why their silence might actually be a sign of strength, not weakness. We'll dive into the power of privacy, the freedom that comes from living without an audience, and why mystery in an oversaturated world creates more value than constant visibility.

If you've ever felt exhausted by the pressure to document everything, or if you've wondered what it would be like to simply live without performing, this video offers a different perspective. We'll examine how not posting protects your emotional security, deepens your relationships, and allows you to reclaim experiences as truly your own. Whether you're someone who shares constantly or someone who prefers to stay quiet, this exploration will challenge how you think about identity, connection, and what it means to live authentically in the digital age. Join us for a thoughtful conversation about choosing presence over performance and discovering who you are when no one is watching.

Disclaimer: This is a fan-made channel, and its content is not affiliated with Elon Musk or his companies. The videos are inspired by Elon Musk's public statements and ideas for educational and motivational purposes only, using a synthesized voice that does not belong to Elon Musk. We use visual lip-syncing and dubbed narration to match the spoken words with on-screen footage, purely to enhance clarity, create a cinematic experience, and make the content more engaging for viewers. 

Our aim is to amplify the original message by making it easier to understand for the end consumer, helping us reach and educate more people with Elon Musk's valuable perspectives. We also make the messages of Elon Musk more accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing by applying professional transcription to the majority of our videos. We share his visionary ideas in a respectful and inspiring manner, without any intent to mislead.

Our channel’s content is based on facts, rumors, and fiction. Nothing on this channel is financial or medical advice. Like Elon Musk uses AI in most of his companies, we may sometimes use AI models to help us with specific video production and publishing processes for this channel.

1FuaPalNmjg,"What Social Media Is Doing To Gen Alpha, with Jonathan Haidt","Is social media rewiring childhood and fueling a mental health crisis? Neil deGrasse Tyson is joined by comic co-host Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly to explore the costs of growing up online and how to take back childhood with social psychologist and author of The Anxious Generation, Jonathan Haidt.

Have we been overprotecting kids in the real world and underprotecting them online? What happens when children miss out on risky play that builds resilience and antifragility? Could over-cushioned playgrounds and cancelled sports have set the stage long before Instagram arrived? 

We discuss the developing brain in adolescents and why it's a critical period for socialization. How does myelination contribute to locking in behaviors during puberty? What happens if social skills fail to develop during critical windows? Can TikTok rewiring replace the conflict and growth of real-world interaction?

Are tech companies exploiting adolescent fears of missing out? Do algorithms push kids toward loneliness instead of connection? We compare which platforms cause the most harm: Instagram’s social comparison, TikTok’s “brainrot,” Snapchat’s dangers, or Discord’s hidden risks.

How will Gen Z, the first generation raised on the internet, raise their own children? Can communities, schools, and even state laws restore independence and protect kids without criminalizing parents? And how do we confront the next wave of technologies, AI “friends” embedded in toys, and chatbots designed to keep children hooked?

Learn about the four steps individuals and communities can take to help reclaim childhood socialization: no smartphones before high school, no social media before 16, phone-free schools, and far more independence in the real world. Will families, educators, and governments rally to make this change or are we heading for “sociological apocalypse”?

In 2021, Gary created VeeFriends, an entertainment company that has become a rising powerhouse in modern entertainment and collectibles. Often described as Pokemon meets Sesame Street, the company leverages stories, games, events, collectibles, and technology to scale its character universe. Vaynerchuk also has negotiated partnerships with brand powerhouses such as Crocs, Fanatics, Macy’s/Toys “R” Us, Mattel’s UNO, Mattel’s Masters of the Universe, Moonbug Entertainment, Reebok, Squishmallows, Topps, and more.

Gary is also the founder and creator of VeeCon – a contemporary super conference that converges business and pop culture with innovation and technology. He is a six-time New York Times bestselling author, with titles including Crush It!, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, Twelve and a Half and Day Trading Attention.

In 2022 nearly half of Americans expected a civil war in the next few years, one in five now believes political violence is justified. And it is not just the US but around the world. People increasingly see themselves as part of opposing teams.

There are many different reasons for this, but one gets blamed a lot: social media. Social media divides us, makes us more extreme and less empathetic, it riles us up or sucks us into doom scrolling, making us stressed and depressed. It feels like we need to touch grass and escape to the real world. 

New research shows that we might have largely misinterpreted why this is the case. It turns out that the social media internet may uniquely undermine the way our brains work but not in the way you think.

NzNQRGQ6Phk,Why Australia is Blocking Children from Social Media? | Vantage with Palki Sharma | N18G,"Australia will enforce a nationwide ban on social media accounts for all children under 16 from 10 December. The law, passed last year, requires platforms to shut down existing underage accounts, block new sign-ups and verify user ages through technologies such as facial estimation, video selfies, government ID checks and AI-based tools. Major platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, X, YouTube, Reddit, Threads, Twitch and Kick are included, while WhatsApp and Pinterest are excluded. The move follows data showing 96% of Australian children aged 10 to 15 use social media, with high exposure to harmful content. Other countries are watching the rollout.

The lives people share on social media, don't reflect the reality they live in. After the privacy crisis in the past year, Mark Zuckerberg had to speak in front of congress.

Social media effects on your mental health are scary and we need to do something about it.

4TMPXK9tw5U,The Battle for Your Time: Exposing the Costs of Social Media | Dino Ambrosi | TEDxLagunaBlancaSchool,"Do we truly comprehend how much of our time and attention is given to technology? In his talk, Dino Ambrosi reframes how we think about our relationships to devices, and shares his ideas on how to create healthy digital habits. 
 Dino Ambrosi, the founder of Project Reboot, is an expert at guiding teens and young adults to relationships with technology that empower them. While studying at UC Berkeley, he created a popular course called Becoming Tech Intentional which he taught to over 60 of his fellow students who reduced their screen time by an average of over 3 hours per day. After graduating in May, he embarked on a mission to spread the contents of his course to a broader audience. Through school assemblies, workshops, and consulting, he has worked with over 500 students and parents to raise awareness about the addictive potential of our devices, drive conversations around digital wellness, and deliver practical strategies to build healthy digital habits. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

csubiPlvFWk,How Smartphones & Social Media Impact Mental Health & the Realistic Solutions | Dr. Jonathan Haidt,"In this episode, my guest is Dr. Jonathan Haidt, Ph.D., professor of social psychology at New York University and bestselling author on how technology and culture impact the psychology and health of kids, teens, and adults. We discuss the dramatic rise of suicide, depression, and anxiety as a result of replacing a play-based childhood with smartphones, social media, and video games.
 
He explains how a screen-filled childhood leads to challenges in psychological development that negatively impact learning, resilience, identity, cooperation, and conflict resolution — all of which are crucial skills for future adult relationships and career success. We also discuss how phones and social media impact boys and girls differently and the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of how smartphones alter basic brain plasticity and function. 
 
Dr. Haidt explains his four recommendations for healthier smartphone use in kids, and we discuss how to restore childhood independence and play in the current generation. 

This is an important topic for everyone, young or old, parents and teachers, students and families, to be aware of in order to understand the potential mental health toll of smartphone use and to apply tools to foster skill-building and reestablish healthy norms for our kids.

This is a pilot episode of a new podcast-like format that we're calling ""Howtown Showdown."" In it, we flip a coin to take sides in a contentious scientific debate and look for the strongest evidence supporting our respective positions. For this first episode, we dive into the academic controversy sparked by Jonathan Haidt's best-selling book, The Anxious Generation, which argues that social media apps on smartphones are a major driver of declining mental-health outcomes among young people. The trends show rising anxiety, depression, and self-harm among teenagers in the United States and several other English-speaking countries. But does the evidence really show that social media is the problem?

fxHicgbwjQg,3 Shocking Truths About WOMEN Who DON'T POST on SOCIAL MEDIA,"Ever wonder why some women seem effortlessly magnetic to quality men? 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM3SPGJP0oY

The answer might surprise you - it's not what they're doing, it's what they're NOT doing. In this revealing video, discover the three powerful reasons why men find women who aren't on social media absolutely irresistible.

What you'll learn:
-  Why saying ""I don't have Instagram"" makes you instantly more attractive
- The psychology behind why men are drawn to women with mystery
- How social media addiction is sabotaging your dating life
- Why your attention span directly affects your relationship success
- The difference between being accessible vs. being available to everyone
- How to stand out in a world of copy-cat women

This video is perfect if you:
• Feel overwhelmed by social media pressure and beauty standards
• Want to attract men who value substance over superficiality
• Are tired of competing with other women online
• Crave deeper, more meaningful connections
• Want to develop unshakeable confidence from within

The brutal truth: While other women are fighting for likes and validation online, women who step away from social media become rare gems that quality men can't ignore. Learn why your presence, attention, and originality are your secret weapons in dating.

Real talk from a man's perspective - discover what really goes through a guy's mind when he meets a woman who chooses real life over the digital world. This isn't about being anti-technology; it's about being intentional with your energy and attention.

YlAuHZsFmhU,Meta to start closing Australian teen accounts ahead of social media ban | BBC News,"Australian teenagers on Instagram, Facebook and Threads are being told their accounts will be shut down ahead of the country's social media ban for under-16s.
 
Meta, which owns the three brands, said it had begun notifying users it believes to be between 13 and 15 years old that their accounts would start being deactivated from 4 December.
 
It’s the world’s strictest law relating to social media and the way young people use it.
 
The ban comes into force on 10 December and affects a number of platforms which also include TikTok, YouTube, X and Reddit.
 
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the ban was aimed at ""letting kids be kids"". Meta and other firms oppose the measure but said they would comply.

in a world where we’re perpetually plugged in, it’s easy to forget that going #offline used to just mean… turning off your computer.
now the internet bleeds into every corner of our lives - work, relationships, entertainment, even rest - and more people than ever are burning out from the constant #doomscrolling. moreover, logging off has shifted from a simple choice to a full-blown lifestyle trend… one that’s being packaged, branded, and sold back to us.

so in this video we’re talking everything wrong with today’s social media (#aislop , #brainrot, algorithmic chaos), the rise of “digital detox” content and social media quitting, why being offline has become a status symbol, and how disconnection itself is turning into a luxury most people can’t afford.

LGx_cmEH8Lw,Psychology of People Who Don't Post their Photos on Social Media,"Why do some people never post pictures online — no selfies, no updates, no trace of their personal life?
In a world that rewards visibility, their silence stands out.

Psychology says this behavior reveals something deeper — about confidence, boundaries, and emotional intelligence.
These people might not crave attention, but they understand something most of us overlook about human nature and the digital world.

In this video, you’ll discover the real psychology behind people who choose privacy over popularity — and why that might be a sign of strength, not insecurity.

This insight goes beyond social media. It’s about self-awareness, identity, and how deeply our minds adapt to constant exposure.

🔔 Stay till the end — you’ll never look at “quiet” people online the same way again.
And if you love understanding how people think and why they behave the way they do, hit subscribe — because here, we don’t just scroll… we decode the mind.

https://bit.ly/32voKpY
 
For the first time in history, mental illness and suicide have become one of the greatest threats to school-aged children. Many parents still view dangers as primarily physical and external, but they’re missing the real danger: kids spending more time online and less time engaging in real life, free play, and autonomy. What are the effects on the next generation's mental, physical, and spiritual health? Childhood was more or less unchanged for millennia, but this is CHILDHOOD 2.0.

IXlPNCHVX64,"Chicago’s Mayor Wants to Tax Cloud Computing, Social Media… Even Employees","Chicago is collapsing in real time because Democrats handed a $16.7 billion budget to a guy whose last big management job was an elementary school classroom. Now Mayor Brandon Johnson wants to tax literally everything that moves in Chicago — employees, cloud computing, social media, grocery stores, and more — instead of cutting the waste and corruption that’s sinking the city.

While Johnson is busy trying to shake down businesses, Chicago Public Schools is getting roasted by its own Inspector General for “travel abuse” — blowing millions of dollars on luxury trips, including almost $1,000-a-night Vegas hotels and South Africa “professional development” junkets that conveniently included wildlife tours and tourist fun with no real educational value. Travel spending has more than doubled since 2019, even as CPS screams about a massive budget hole.

LGx_cmEH8Lw,Psychology of People Who Don't Post their Photos on Social Media,"Why do some people never post pictures online — no selfies, no updates, no trace of their personal life?
In a world that rewards visibility, their silence stands out.

Psychology says this behavior reveals something deeper — about confidence, boundaries, and emotional intelligence.
These people might not crave attention, but they understand something most of us overlook about human nature and the digital world.

In this video, you’ll discover the real psychology behind people who choose privacy over popularity — and why that might be a sign of strength, not insecurity.

This insight goes beyond social media. It’s about self-awareness, identity, and how deeply our minds adapt to constant exposure.

🔔 Stay till the end — you’ll never look at “quiet” people online the same way again.
And if you love understanding how people think and why they behave the way they do, hit subscribe — because here, we don’t just scroll… we decode the mind.

4OUW20Usi30,The Psychology of People Who Don’t Post on Social Media,"The Psychology of People Who Don’t Post on Social Media

We live in a world obsessed with sharing, yet some people remain completely invisible online. They scroll quietly, observe deeply, and never post. Why do they choose silence when the whole world is shouting for attention? This video dives deep into the fascinating psychology behind 'ghost scrollers' and non-posters. It's not just about being shy; it’s about control, emotional independence, and a quiet rebellion against a culture that equates visibility with value. We explore the concepts of psychological ownership, internal locus of control, and the hidden peace found when you detach your worth from digital applause. If you've ever felt burnt out by the performance of social media, or wondered about the power of being unseen, this analysis is for you. Discover why sometimes, the most profound things happen quietly, and how non-posters might just be guarding their authenticity in a staged world.",Kee,2025-10-15T19:35:23Z,3127245,108986,9249,social media

The lives people share on social media, don't reflect the reality they live in. After the privacy crisis in the past year, Mark Zuckerberg had to speak in front of congress.

Gary Vaynerchuk is a serial entrepreneur and serves as the Chairman of VaynerX, the CEO of VaynerMedia, and the CEO and creator of VeeFriends. Gary is considered one of the leading global minds on what's next in culture, business, and the internet.

Known as ""GaryVee,"" he is described as one of the most forward thinkers in business. He acutely recognizes trends and patterns early to help others understand how shifts in consumer attention impact the realities of the business world today. Gary's approach sits at the intersection of business and pop culture. He keenly understands how to bring brand relevance to the forefront. He is a prolific angel investor with early investments in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, Coinbase, and Uber.

Gary is an entrepreneur at heart – he builds businesses. Today, he helps Fortune 1000 brands leverage consumer attention through his full-service advertising agency, VaynerMedia, which has offices in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Toronto, Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, Delhi, and Kuala Lumpur. VaynerMedia is part of the VaynerX holding company, which also includes Eva Nosidam Productions, Gallery Media Group, The Sasha Group, VaynerSpeakers, VaynerCommerce, and Tingley Lane Trading. Gary is the Co-Founder of VaynerSports, VCR Group, VaynerWatt, ArtOfficial, Resy, and Empathy Wines. He guided Resy and Empathy to successful exits -- which he later sold to American Express and Constellation Brands, respectively. He also owns a Major League Pickleball team called the 5s, is part owner of a Big3 basketball team, and is an investor in the revival of the SlamBall League.

In 2021, Gary created VeeFriends, an entertainment company that has become a rising powerhouse in modern entertainment and collectibles. Often described as Pokemon meets Sesame Street, the company leverages stories, games, events, collectibles, and technology to scale its character universe. Vaynerchuk also has negotiated partnerships with brand powerhouses such as Crocs, Fanatics, Macy’s/Toys “R” Us, Mattel’s UNO, Mattel’s Masters of the Universe, Moonbug Entertainment, Reebok, Squishmallows, Topps, and more.

Gary is also the founder and creator of VeeCon – a contemporary super conference that converges business and pop culture with innovation and technology. He is a six-time New York Times bestselling author, with titles including Crush It!, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, Twelve and a Half and Day Trading Attention. In addition to running multiple businesses, Gary documents his daily life as a CEO through his social media channels, which have more than 45 million followers and garner more than 300 million monthly impressions/views across all platforms. His podcast, ""The GaryVee Audio Experience,"" ranks among the top podcasts globally.

Gary serves on the board of MikMak, Bojangles Restaurants, Global Citizen Forum, The Paley Center, and Pencils of Promise. He is also a longtime Well Member of charity: water.

Gary's life ambition is to buy the New York Jets.",GaryVee,2025-10-17T19:00:24Z,118781,4258,260,social media

https://bit.ly/32voKpY
 
For the first time in history, mental illness and suicide have become one of the greatest threats to school-aged children. Many parents still view dangers as primarily physical and external, but they’re missing the real danger: kids spending more time online and less time engaging in real life, free play, and autonomy. What are the effects on the next generation's mental, physical, and spiritual health? Childhood was more or less unchanged for millennia, but this is CHILDHOOD 2.0.

Sources & further reading: https://sites.google.com/view/sources-why-we-hate-each-other/

In 2022 nearly half of Americans expected a civil war in the next few years, one in five now believes political violence is justified. And it is not just the US but around the world. People increasingly see themselves as part of opposing teams.

There are many different reasons for this, but one gets blamed a lot: social media. Social media divides us, makes us more extreme and less empathetic, it riles us up or sucks us into doom scrolling, making us stressed and depressed. It feels like we need to touch grass and escape to the real world. 

New research shows that we might have largely misinterpreted why this is the case. It turns out that the social media internet may uniquely undermine the way our brains work but not in the way you think.

LMUlQeRbKjY,How to INSTANTLY Build a FULL Marketing Team with 1 AI Agent,"Build your own AI Marketing Automation: https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/ke6a2t4eexp2

I just built an entire marketing team that works 24/7, never takes breaks, and costs me practically nothing. We're talking copywriters, email specialists, sales letter experts—the whole squad. And they're not human.

But here's the thing—most people think you need to hire expensive agencies or spend months learning complex automation tools to get professional marketing copy. That's exactly what I thought too.

However, what I discovered completely changed everything. Because the most powerful marketing team you can build isn't made of people at all—it's made of specialized AI agents that can outwrite most humans and work around the clock.

I'm about to show you the exact system I created using n8n that automatically generates cold email sequences, VSL scripts, and sales letters on demand. No coding experience required. And by the end of this video, you'll be able to build your own AI marketing army.

AI marketing  is essential for boosting consumer loyalty, corporate growth, and profitability. Sales revenues keep coming in as long as companies are able to meet or even surpass customer expectations in terms of product quality, service delivery, and touchpoint experiences. It is practically a given that clients who are truly satisfied will be happy to continue making purchases from companies that offer high-quality goods and services. Additionally, they are more inclined to recommend the company to their friends and family after having a wonderful experience with sales and service.
Artificial intelligence-based marketing efficiently automates data collection and behavioral targeting to assist firms in achieving their objectives. It eliminates human prejudice because it is used in digital channels. The data collected is thought to be more accurate and realistic in displaying actual customer preferences and online behavior.

Using preprogrammed algorithms, computers gather and process data using AI. Consumer behavior is observed when they read material, reply to affiliate marketing offers, and engage with content and social media posts. Taking it a step further, AI automatically contacts clients or prospects who display a particular behavior. With the use of technological tools, platforms, and analytics, this kind of behavior targeting is made possible.

AI marketing is the greatest strategy to use when speed is of the essence. You cannot dally and spend hours sorting and evaluating information, especially in the internet environment where your competitors are likely to be available round-the-clock and clients are searching for instant answers and solutions to their problems. Only AI will allow you to provide them with the wants and needs they have at that precise moment.

Without spending any time and without the assistance of a marketing staff, AI technologies can quickly use the data they collect to communicate using tailored messages at the point of contact. It's a helpful and effective technique to interact with clients and guarantee satisfaction. Data analysis, media buying, content creation, natural language processing, automated decision-making, and real-time customisation are a few other applications of AI marketing.
Scientifically based models are used in artificial intelligence. It is not at all random. AI borrows the cycle of perception, reasoning, and action from cognitive science. This principle is represented by the collect-reason-act cycle in artificial intelligence words.

The term ""collect"" refers to all actions involving gathering client information from both online and offline sources and storing it in databases. Reasoning is the next step, which is when AI turns data into intelligence or useful insight. AI then takes action based on the information acquired and communicates with customers in an effort to prompt and motivate them to take the desired action, which is often to make a purchase.

Machine learning, commonly known as ML, is a branch of artificial intelligence that investigates computer techniques in greater detail and creates models from data obtained. Applications are able to make predictions and judgments because to the models that are created using ML. ML is hence sometimes referred to as predictive analysis.

In this video, I break down how Google’s AI is quietly rewriting the rules, and how you can train it to cite your brand as the trusted source. This isn’t about chasing keywords. It’s about showing up in AI Overviews, owning high-intent moments, and building authority while your competitors chase outdated SEO tactics.

I’ll show you:

- How Google’s AI decides who gets visibility — even if you rank #1
- Where AI Overviews actually show up (and where they don’t)
- Why the real battle is for citations, not clicks
- How to reverse-engineer the content AI already trusts
- The one move that turns search into a brand-building engine

Gary Vaynerchuk is a serial entrepreneur and serves as the Chairman of VaynerX, the CEO of VaynerMedia, and the CEO and creator of VeeFriends. Gary is considered one of the leading global minds on what's next in culture, business, and the internet.

Known as ""GaryVee,"" he is described as one of the most forward thinkers in business. He acutely recognizes trends and patterns early to help others understand how shifts in consumer attention impact the realities of the business world today. Gary's approach sits at the intersection of business and pop culture. He keenly understands how to bring brand relevance to the forefront. He is a prolific angel investor with early investments in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, Coinbase, and Uber.

Gary is an entrepreneur at heart – he builds businesses. Today, he helps Fortune 1000 brands leverage consumer attention through his full-service advertising agency, VaynerMedia, which has offices in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Toronto, Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, Delhi, and Kuala Lumpur. VaynerMedia is part of the VaynerX holding company, which also includes Eva Nosidam Productions, Gallery Media Group, The Sasha Group, VaynerSpeakers, VaynerCommerce, and Tingley Lane Trading. Gary is the Co-Founder of VaynerSports, VCR Group, VaynerWatt, ArtOfficial, Resy, and Empathy Wines. He guided Resy and Empathy to successful exits -- which he later sold to American Express and Constellation Brands, respectively. He also owns a Major League Pickleball team called the 5s, is part owner of a Big3 basketball team, and is an investor in the revival of the SlamBall League.

In 2021, Gary created VeeFriends, an entertainment company that has become a rising powerhouse in modern entertainment and collectibles. Often described as Pokemon meets Sesame Street, the company leverages stories, games, events, collectibles, and technology to scale its character universe. Vaynerchuk also has negotiated partnerships with brand powerhouses such as Crocs, Fanatics, Macy’s/Toys “R” Us, Mattel’s UNO, Mattel’s Masters of the Universe, Moonbug Entertainment, Reebok, Squishmallows, Topps, and more.

Gary is also the founder and creator of VeeCon – a contemporary super conference that converges business and pop culture with innovation and technology. He is a six-time New York Times bestselling author, with titles including Crush It!, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, Twelve and a Half and Day Trading Attention. In addition to running multiple businesses, Gary documents his daily life as a CEO through his social media channels, which have more than 45 million followers and garner more than 300 million monthly impressions/views across all platforms. His podcast, ""The GaryVee Audio Experience,"" ranks among the top podcasts globally.

Gary serves on the board of MikMak, Bojangles Restaurants, Global Citizen Forum, The Paley Center, and Pencils of Promise. He is also a longtime Well Member of charity: water.

He is a prolific angel investor with early investments in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, Coinbase, and Uber.

This year, Gary unveiled his seventh book, ""Day Trading Attention"" where he provides fresh insights into navigating the modern social media landscape. Gary's expertise guides readers on harnessing underpriced attention channels in the digital age. He emphasizes mastering storytelling in these arenas and highlights the ""TikTokification of Social Media,"" where content relevance surpasses follower counts. Businesses can leverage this shift to enhance their brand and boost sales. ""Day Trading Attention"" equips readers with essential skills to succeed in today's dynamic digital world. Gary also announced his first children's picture book, based on his VeeFriends characters, titled ""Meet Me in the Middle” (set to be published on July 16, 2024). The picture book, which will prominently feature two VeeFriends characters, Eager Eagle and Patient Pig, delves into the emotional elements essential for nurturing children's empathy – a crucial skill for their future success.

If you thought that only your grandchildren will see AI dominating areas that humans could, well, think again, because there's some really cool tools that you need to check out. Over the last few years, the development of AI has skyrocketed. Tasks that would take you hours to complete can now be done in minutes automatically.

In marketing, there are already quite a few things that you can do much faster. There's a quote by Larry Page, one of the founders of Google that says, ""Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. The ultimate search engine that would understand everything on the web. It would understand exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing."" The global artificial intelligent market size will grow from 93.53 billion in 2021 to 997 billion in 2028. That's almost a trillion dollars. That's pretty much 10x. 

So how can you harness the power of these technologies in your marketing day-to-day? Well, AI can already do the things like designing custom logos, optimizing your paid ad campaigns, helping you write great content, and a lot of other interesting things. But most people aren't familiar with these technologies, and they still spend a lot of manual time doing the stuff that can already be automated. To be honest, up until now, I was also doing a lot of them manually, but over the last six months to a year, I've learned about a lot of these tools. 

So let's dive right in. There's CopyAI. This AI tool generates tons of copy from just one basic summary text that you input. From product descriptions to paid ad copy, to even blog titles, it can help in several different areas of marketing activities. 

Then there's Beautiful.ai. If you hate coming up with presentations because, hey, the design suck, it's messy, takes a lot of time, this tool is perfect for you. It uses AI to automatically enhance your designs accordingly so that your content looks beautiful. And it adjusts it based on your content. So you don't even need to worry about messing with the layouts. 

Then you got Profile Picture Maker. This tool uses AI to remove the background from your photos and make amazing profile photos for you to use on social media or even company about pages, like those headshots that people show on the executive pages. The end result is pretty amazing, and best all, it's absolutely free. 

Then you got Brandmark.io. Now, you don't even need a graphic designer to come up with a logo for your business. This tool uses AI to create logos automatically for you based on a set of preferences. It creates dozens and dozens of different variations that you can pick from and choose from. And if you like one of them and want to use on your business, you can purchase that logo right then and there. 

Then you got Oribi.io. This tool is basically analytics on steroids. It will automatically track all the events on your website and come up with the suggestions of things that you could be doing to improve your performance. It'll look at things like your conversion funnels, traffic sources, identify the strengths, opportunities for improvements. It pretty much does a lot of stuff automatically for you. 

Next, Synthesia.io. If you're camera shy and you don't like to talk in public, you may like this one. It generates video that looks almost identical to a human speaking, and it'll almost freak you out because it is pretty realistic. 

Then you got Unscreen.com. This tool also allows you to remove the background from any video that you shoot. You know, people are just like, ""Oh yeah, I can remove background images."" I'm talking about video images. You don't even need a green screen or anything like that. It'll remove even the more complex backgrounds.

I share my two cents on AI's potential in creative fields like music and art, comparing it to past technological shifts like electricity and the advent of canvas art. The conversation also touches on the fragmentation of media consumption due to personalized algorithms and the early stages of AI adoption in marketing, highlighting both the potential and the challenges that lie ahead.

Gary Vaynerchuk is a serial entrepreneur and serves as the Chairman of VaynerX, the CEO of VaynerMedia, and the Creator & CEO of VeeFriends. Gary is considered one of the leading global minds on what's next in culture, business, and the internet.

Known as ""GaryVee,"" he is described as one of the most forward thinkers in business. He acutely recognizes trends and patterns early to help others understand how shifts in consumer attention impact the realities of the business world today. Gary's approach sits at the intersection of business and pop culture. He keenly understands how to bring brand relevance to the forefront. He is a prolific angel investor with early investments in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, Coinbase, and Uber.

This year, Gary unveiled his seventh book, ""Day Trading Attention"" where he provides fresh insights into navigating the modern social media landscape. Gary's expertise guides readers on harnessing underpriced attention channels in the digital age. He emphasizes mastering storytelling in these arenas and highlights the ""TikTokification of Social Media,"" where content relevance surpasses follower counts. Businesses can leverage this shift to enhance their brand and boost sales. ""Day Trading Attention"" equips readers with essential skills to succeed in today's dynamic digital world. Gary also announced his first children's picture book, based on his VeeFriends characters, titled ""Meet Me in the Middle”. The picture book, which will prominently feature two VeeFriends characters, Eager Eagle and Patient Pig, delves into the emotional elements essential for nurturing children's empathy – a crucial skill for their future success.

Gary is an entrepreneur at heart – he builds businesses. Today, he helps Fortune 1000 brands leverage consumer attention through his full-service advertising agency, VaynerMedia, which has offices in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur. VaynerMedia is part of the VaynerX holding company, which also includes Eva Nosidam Productions, Gallery Media Group, The Sasha Group, VaynerSpeakers, VaynerCommerce, and Tingley Lane Trading. Gary is the Co-Founder of VaynerSports, VCR Group, VaynerWatt, ArtOfficial, Resy, and Empathy Wines. He guided Resy and Empathy to successful exits -- which he later sold to American Express and Constellation Brands, respectively. He also owns a Major League Pickleball team called the 5s, is part owner of a Big3 basketball team, and is an investor in the revival of the SlamBall League.

Gary is also the founder and creator of VeeCon – a contemporary super conference that converges business and pop culture with innovation and technology. In addition to running multiple businesses, Gary documents his daily life as a CEO through his social media channels, which have more than 44 million followers and garner over 300 million monthly impressions/views across all platforms. His podcast, ""The GaryVee Audio Experience,"" ranks among the top podcasts globally.

Gary serves on the board of MikMak, Bojangles Restaurants, Global Citizen Forum, and Pencils of Promise. He is also a longtime Well Member of charity: water.",GaryVee,2024-08-12T16:00:23Z,50926,1208,100,AI marketing

GERy0Xli89Y,This AI agent can replace your entire marketing department.,"Astral is controversial because it can log into websites like Reddit, TikTok, and Instagram, open up individual posts, and then leave a comment that seems human-generated while also pointing to a promotional product or service.

Most people would assume that Astral's comments are human-generated, which is why this is controversial – Shawn Wang called Astral out, saying, “imagine being proud of this” because essentially, Astral is creating AI agents that are pretending to be human.

At the same time though, people do make purchasing decisions based on social media comments, which is why Aniket Das said Astral is a ‘Utopia for all B2C founders’.",Plivo,2025-01-25T13:00:29Z,11863,556,3,AI marketing

AI marketing  is essential for boosting consumer loyalty, corporate growth, and profitability. Sales revenues keep coming in as long as companies are able to meet or even surpass customer expectations in terms of product quality, service delivery, and touchpoint experiences. It is practically a given that clients who are truly satisfied will be happy to continue making purchases from companies that offer high-quality goods and services. Additionally, they are more inclined to recommend the company to their friends and family after having a wonderful experience with sales and service.
Artificial intelligence-based marketing efficiently automates data collection and behavioral targeting to assist firms in achieving their objectives. It eliminates human prejudice because it is used in digital channels. The data collected is thought to be more accurate and realistic in displaying actual customer preferences and online behavior.

Using preprogrammed algorithms, computers gather and process data using AI. Consumer behavior is observed when they read material, reply to affiliate marketing offers, and engage with content and social media posts. Taking it a step further, AI automatically contacts clients or prospects who display a particular behavior. With the use of technological tools, platforms, and analytics, this kind of behavior targeting is made possible.

AI marketing is the greatest strategy to use when speed is of the essence. You cannot dally and spend hours sorting and evaluating information, especially in the internet environment where your competitors are likely to be available round-the-clock and clients are searching for instant answers and solutions to their problems. Only AI will allow you to provide them with the wants and needs they have at that precise moment.

Without spending any time and without the assistance of a marketing staff, AI technologies can quickly use the data they collect to communicate using tailored messages at the point of contact. It's a helpful and effective technique to interact with clients and guarantee satisfaction. Data analysis, media buying, content creation, natural language processing, automated decision-making, and real-time customisation are a few other applications of AI marketing.
Scientifically based models are used in artificial intelligence. It is not at all random. AI borrows the cycle of perception, reasoning, and action from cognitive science. This principle is represented by the collect-reason-act cycle in artificial intelligence words.

The term ""collect"" refers to all actions involving gathering client information from both online and offline sources and storing it in databases. Reasoning is the next step, which is when AI turns data into intelligence or useful insight. AI then takes action based on the information acquired and communicates with customers in an effort to prompt and motivate them to take the desired action, which is often to make a purchase.

Machine learning, commonly known as ML, is a branch of artificial intelligence that investigates computer techniques in greater detail and creates models from data obtained. Applications are able to make predictions and judgments because to the models that are created using ML. ML is hence sometimes referred to as predictive analysis.

First you’ve got to find the adverts and openings, then there’s the mental energy and time required to put in an application - and that’s before you get to the nerve wracking interviews. But some of us are finding that process even harder than normal - putting in loads of applications and never hearing back. Some recent studies suggest that AI is a contributing factor, with younger workers being replaced by AI in some industries.

Companies like Amazon and Duolingo have said using AI is going to lead to a reduction in their workforce. 

We hear some of your experiences in the current job market. BBC business reporter in New York, Nathalie Jimenez, explains which sectors are most affected by the adoption of generative AI - and what you can do to try to adapt. Plus Varun Mayya, a YouTuber and the founder of generative AI company Aeos, tells us what the situation is like in India - and how AI is changing how his company operates.

I go over several practical workflows including creating viral AI videos, building AI personas for customer nurturing, generating audio content from text, and creating AI-powered business dashboards. The presentation emphasizes that understanding these tools provides marketers with a significant competitive advantage in the current landscape.

00:00 - Intro
01:27 - Overview of Vibe Marketing
03:30 - MCPs and Workflow Explained
06:45 - Creating faceless video content workflow
09:57 - One-click CRM with Gumloop
13:50 - Voice AI agents with VAPI
16:56 - Creating AI personas with Tavus
21:04 - Generating AI Podcast with String
24:13 - Building Business Health Dashboards with Sting
25:20 - Creating high-converting ads with Arc Ads
27:38 - Growing followers and email lists with short-form video

Key Points:
• Vibe marketing combines AI tools and workflows to create an unfair advantage in today's marketing landscape
• The presenter shares multiple AI workflows including faceless video content creation, one-click CRM, voice AI sales agents, and AI personas
• Tools like Claude, Gumloop, VAPI, Tavus, String, and Arc Ads are demonstrated with specific use cases
• Short-form video content combined with comment-based email collection can rapidly grow followers and email lists

1) What is Vibe Marketing?

It's the powerful overlap between vibe coding tools and AI agent workflow tools that's creating an UNFAIR ADVANTAGE for early adopters.

Think Facebook marketing in 2008 or mobile apps in 2010 - that's the opportunity window we're in RIGHT NOW.

2) The Essential Tech Stack

For serious vibe marketing, you NEED:

• Claude (specifically Sonnet/Opus for agents)
• Docker desktop app
• MCPs (multi-call programs) for accessing tools/data

3) Viral Faceless Video Content

Ever seen those Minecraft/gaming videos with AI voiceovers getting MILLIONS of views?

Here's the workflow:
• Scrape interesting Reddit posts
• Store in Airtable
• Analyze for relevance
• Generate video with RunwayML or VO3
• Stitch with Creatomate
• Post to social

4) One-Click CRM with Gumloop

This is BRILLIANT:

Find someone interesting on social media → press ONE button → AI agent:
• Scrapes their profile
• Researches them across the web
• Stores info in your CRM
• Crafts personalized outreach
• Sends weekly summaries

5) Voice AI Sales Agents (24/7 Selling)

Using VAPI I created a voice AI agent that:
• Sells while he sleeps via 1-800 number
• Collects valuable customer feedback
• Transcribes conversations for insights

6) AI Video Personas That Convert

Using Tavus I created an AI version of myself that:
• Has video conversations with website visitors
• Builds trust 24/7 when he can't be there
• Nurtures leads through personalized interactions

7) Automated Audio Content Creation

Using String, Greg built a workflow that:
• Scrapes daily content from his site
• Creates podcast scripts
• Converts to audio with 11Labs
• Could even auto-publish to Spotify/Apple

8) Business Health Dashboards

Tired of checking analytics across platforms?

I prompted String to create a workflow that:
• Pulls data from PostHog (analytics)
• Checks Stripe for revenue/conversions
• Delivers a daily summary to Slack

9) AI Ad Creation That Actually Works

The secret to high-converting AI ads:

• Find competitors spending millions on ads
• Use Gumloop to scrape and analyze their ads
• Have Arc Ads create similar but unique ads for YOUR product
• Auto-upload to Google Drive
• Alert team in Slack when ready

Leverage competitors' ad spend for your own success!

OpenAI just launched Sora 2 and it's creating billions of views of AI content. But while everyone's making random AI slop for entertainment, smart business owners are asking: ""How can I use this to make money?""

TopView AI just cracked the code by combining Sora 2 technology with their UGC AI Agent. Now you can recreate ANY viral video with your product in just a few clicks.

Gary Vaynerchuk is a serial entrepreneur and serves as the Chairman of VaynerX, the CEO of VaynerMedia, and the Creator & CEO of VeeFriends. Gary is considered one of the leading global minds on what's next in culture, business, and the internet.

Known as ""GaryVee,"" he is described as one of the most forward thinkers in business. He acutely recognizes trends and patterns early to help others understand how shifts in consumer attention impact the realities of the business world today. Gary's approach sits at the intersection of business and pop culture. He keenly understands how to bring brand relevance to the forefront. He is a prolific angel investor with early investments in companies like Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Venmo, Snapchat, Coinbase, and Uber.

This year, Gary unveiled his seventh book, ""Day Trading Attention"" where he provides fresh insights into navigating the modern social media landscape. Gary's expertise guides readers on harnessing underpriced attention channels in the digital age. He emphasizes mastering storytelling in these arenas and highlights the ""TikTokification of Social Media,"" where content relevance surpasses follower counts. Businesses can leverage this shift to enhance their brand and boost sales. ""Day Trading Attention"" equips readers with essential skills to succeed in today's dynamic digital world. Gary also announced his first children's picture book, based on his VeeFriends characters, titled ""Meet Me in the Middle”. The picture book, which will prominently feature two VeeFriends characters, Eager Eagle and Patient Pig, delves into the emotional elements essential for nurturing children's empathy – a crucial skill for their future success.

Gary is an entrepreneur at heart – he builds businesses. Today, he helps Fortune 1000 brands leverage consumer attention through his full-service advertising agency, VaynerMedia, which has offices in New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Mexico City, London, Amsterdam, Sydney, Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Kuala Lumpur. VaynerMedia is part of the VaynerX holding company, which also includes Eva Nosidam Productions, Gallery Media Group, The Sasha Group, VaynerSpeakers, VaynerCommerce, and Tingley Lane Trading. Gary is the Co-Founder of VaynerSports, VCR Group, VaynerWatt, ArtOfficial, Resy, and Empathy Wines. He guided Resy and Empathy to successful exits -- which he later sold to American Express and Constellation Brands, respectively. He also owns a Major League Pickleball team called the 5s, is part owner of a Big3 basketball team, and is an investor in the revival of the SlamBall League.

Gary is also the founder and creator of VeeCon – a contemporary super conference that converges business and pop culture with innovation and technology. In addition to running multiple businesses, Gary documents his daily life as a CEO through his social media channels, which have more than 44 million followers and garner over 300 million monthly impressions/views across all platforms. His podcast, ""The GaryVee Audio Experience,"" ranks among the top podcasts globally.

Gary serves on the board of MikMak, Bojangles Restaurants, Global Citizen Forum, and Pencils of Promise. He is also a longtime Well Member of charity: water.

In this video, I’ve created a Pixar-style Starbucks video ad using AI tools! 🎥✨ First, I used ChatGPT to write a creative script and story for the ad. Then, I generated stunning Pixar-style images using AI text-to-image tools based on prompts provided by ChatGPT. Finally, I converted the images into an animated video using an AI image-to-video tool. The result is a fully AI-generated, high-quality Starbucks ad that looks like it came straight out of Pixar!

Watch this video to see how AI tools can simplify content creation and help bring your creative ideas to life.

============================================

In May 2022, my life changed.

Up until that point, I had spent over 20 years as a serial entrepreneur, founding multiple companies and becoming globally recognized for my expertise in direct marketing, copywriting, compliant marketing, and now, investing in AI & Martech SaaS.

In 2022, my company, Lurn, was on track to hit $40 million/year, and I was preparing to sell it—ready to step back, spend more time with my kids, and move on to my next chapter.

But then, in May 2022, everything changed.

A FedEx package from the FTC landed on my desk.

And just like that, my entire world turned upside down.

The Fight of My Life

For the next 18 months, I battled through a grueling legal process.

- My company was in trouble.
-  The sale I had planned was gone.
-  The lawsuit cost me over $15 million—$2.5M in fines, plus millions more on my team, lawyers, and discovery.

It was one of the hardest times of my life. But as painful as it was, it taught me something invaluable.

Something that I’ve always taught to millions of Entrepreneurs over the 
years…

When Life Pushes You Stand Straight, Smile & Push It The Heck Back

When I finally settled the case, I realized something:

Most entrepreneurs don’t understand compliance… until it’s too late.

How I Made $7.2M with Facebook Ads in 90 Days
https://youtu.be/OFudSfhaMRk

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Ben Heath. I’m the founder and owner of https://heathmedia.co.uk/?el=YTlong-beginners25-home a marketing agency that offers done-for-you services, coaching and educational resources, all with the objective of delivering exceptional marketing results for our clients and customers.

Over the past 9 years we’ve spent more than $100,000,000 on paid social ad campaigns generating more than $400,000,000 in revenue.

We’ve worked with more than 2,000 businesses directly from all over the world and in just about every niche you can think of. And we’ve helped educate hundreds of thousands of business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs.

How I got here…

17 yrs old: Started my first business selling wristbands with two school friends. I made $0.
18 yrs old: Started my first ecommerce business selling second hand video games. I made $0.
19 yrs old: Joined a network marketing company (would not recommend it). Was told I’d be rich if I signed up 8 people. I signed up 26 people in 3 months. I made $0.
21 yrs old: Dropped out of Bath University to start an app development company. I made less than $5,000 in 2 years!
23 yrs old: Started Heath Media, my marketing agency. I made $0 for the first 3 years.
26 yrs old: Went all in on building a personal brand within the marketing space. I passed $100k/year.
28 yrs old: My personal brand allowed me to attract the best talent in the world. Heath Media became an industry leading Meta ads agency, with an exceptional team and an excellent reputation. We crossed $1m/year.
32 yrs old: Today I teach over 800,000 business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs how to get insane results with digital marketing. Heath Media is a 50+ team of world class talent, working directly with over 400 clients every year. We’ve now crossed the $5m/year mark.

To all the struggling marketers and entrepreneurs… I was an entrepreneur for 9 years before I could even pay the bills with my own business. 5 years after that I have more success and more fun than I could have ever dreamed of.

It takes perseverance, analysis and learning from the right person.

If you took the time to read this far, you have what it takes to crush it with your marketing. 

I hope to help you speed up that journey and come along for the ride.

Keep going,

Ben

Hi, I'm Chris Heckman. Over the past decade, I’ve built 8 brands to 7-figures, generating over $25M in sales, and exited from 6 of them. Now, I run a 7-figure POD Shopify brand to show that POD is alive and thriving with the right tools. Unlike others who sell pricey courses, I’m offering my complete course for free, so you can judge my credibility based on my results.

My brands:
- Historeetees.com (SOLD)
- Yogaste.co (SOLD)
Proof: Google ""OpenStore acquires HistoreeTees""

My experience…

- 22: Graduated from Penn State, joined Amazon.
- 23: Quit Amazon to start a Facebook ad agency for e-commerce.
- 24: Joined a house with 12 entrepreneurs.
- 25: Ran four 7-figure Shopify brands.
- 27: Reached $20M in e-commerce sales; exited all brands (e.g., Yogaste.co).
- 28: Launched 2 more 7-figure POD Shopify stores (historeetees.com).
- 29: Sold 1 POD store, started a YouTube channel to share free POD success tips.
- 30: Created a 21-hour course, now growing We Scale and Mystic POD to simplify POD for beginners.

Today: Our POD Shopify store does +10K profit/month and we are going to scale this to 40K profit/month, showing all the steps along the way.

To those just starting their journey, burn the boats. Business is never easy, but the wins outweigh the lessons that are learned along the way. Take the leap because you’re never guaranteed tomorrow.

Let’s scale,
Chris

*Get Marketer's Guide to Meta: Tactics for Facebook + Instagram from HubSpot* 🔗 https://clickhubspot.com/86b567

Facebook has 3 billion users, and Meta's new Advantage+ system just rewrote all the advertising rules.

THE BIG CHANGES:
Creative testing now MANDATORY (AI needs multiple assets)
Budget caps GONE (automatic allocation)
Manual targeting REPLACED by AI-powered buyer discovery
Campaign structure SIMPLIFIED (fewer campaigns, broader targeting)

If you're still running Facebook ads like it's 2024, you're burning money.

The new system requires multiple creative assets and uses AI optimization to find buyers you never knew existed. Single-ad campaigns are dead. This isn't just an update - it's a complete reimagining of how Facebook delivers ads.

Are you ready to adapt your Facebook ad strategy for 2025?

Want my agency to do it for you? Go here: https://heathmedia.co.uk/done-for-you/?el=YTlong-SmallBudget1124-fbdfy

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Ben Heath. I’m the founder and owner of https://heathmedia.co.uk/?el=YTlong-SmallBudget1124-home a marketing agency that offers done-for-you services, coaching and educational resources, all with the objective of delivering exceptional marketing results for our clients and customers.

Over the past 9 years we’ve spent more than $100,000,000 on paid social ad campaigns generating more than $400,000,000 in revenue.

We’ve worked with more than 2,000 businesses directly from all over the world and in just about every niche you can think of. And we’ve helped educate hundreds of thousands of business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs.

How I got here…

17 yrs old: Started my first business selling wristbands with two school friends. I made $0.
18 yrs old: Started my first ecommerce business selling second hand video games. I made $0.
19 yrs old: Joined a network marketing company (would not recommend it). Was told I’d be rich if I signed up 8 people. I signed up 26 people in 3 months. I made $0.
21 yrs old: Dropped out of Bath University to start an app development company. I made less than $5,000 in 2 years!
23 yrs old: Started Heath Media, my marketing agency. I made $0 for the first 3 years.
26 yrs old: Went all in on building a personal brand within the marketing space. I passed $100k/year.
28 yrs old: My personal brand allowed me to attract the best talent in the world. Heath Media became an industry leading Meta ads agency, with an exceptional team and an excellent reputation. We crossed $1m/year.
32 yrs old: Today I teach over 800,000 business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs how to get insane results with digital marketing. Heath Media is a 50+ team of world class talent, working directly with over 400 clients every year. We’ve now crossed the $5m/year mark.

- Using phone numbers and emails to target is a great way to reach people who have already expressed interest in your business. If you have a list of customer phone numbers or email addresses, you can upload them to Facebook and create a custom audience. This will allow you to show your ads to people who are already familiar with your brand, which can lead to higher conversion rates.

2 - Using related audiences is another great way to reach people who are likely to be interested in your products or services. When you create a related audience, you’re essentially saying, “I want to show my ads to people who are similar to my existing customers.” Facebook will then use its algorithms to find people who have similar interests, demographics, and behaviors as your existing customers.  #basicfacebookads #relatedaudience #facebookadstips #facebookadsmanager",Damini Tripathi,2023-07-16T15:43:49Z,36505,1729,28,facebook ads

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Ben Heath. I’m the founder and owner of https://heathmedia.co.uk/?el=YTshorts-home a marketing agency that offers done-for-you services, coaching and educational resources, all with the objective of delivering exceptional marketing results for our clients and customers.

Over the past 9 years we’ve spent more than $100,000,000 on paid social ad campaigns generating more than $400,000,000 in revenue.

We’ve worked with more than 2,000 businesses directly from all over the world and in just about every niche you can think of. And we’ve helped educate hundreds of thousands of business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs.

How I got here…

17 yrs old: Started my first business selling wristbands with two school friends. I made $0.
18 yrs old: Started my first ecommerce business selling second hand video games. I made $0.
19 yrs old: Joined a network marketing company (would not recommend it). Was told I’d be rich if I signed up 8 people. I signed up 26 people in 3 months. I made $0.
21 yrs old: Dropped out of Bath University to start an app development company. I made less than $5,000 in 2 years!
23 yrs old: Started Heath Media, my marketing agency. I made $0 for the first 3 years.
26 yrs old: Went all in on building a personal brand within the marketing space. I passed $100k/year.
28 yrs old: My personal brand allowed me to attract the best talent in the world. Heath Media became an industry leading Meta ads agency, with an exceptional team and an excellent reputation. We crossed $1m/year.
32 yrs old: Today I teach over 800,000 business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs how to get insane results with digital marketing. Heath Media is a 50+ team of world class talent, working directly with over 400 clients every year. We’ve now crossed the $5m/year mark.

To all the struggling marketers and entrepreneurs… I was an entrepreneur for 9 years before I could even pay the bills with my own business. 5 years after that I have more success and more fun than I could have ever dreamed of.

It takes perseverance, analysis and learning from the right person.

If you took the time to read this far, you have what it takes to crush it with your marketing. 

I hope to help you speed up that journey and come along for the ride.

Keep going,

Ben

vhkWexXFtw8,How to Run Ads on Instagram - Complete Instagram Ads Tutorial,"Run Instagram Ads using Facebook.  Don't use the promote button on Instagram to run ads.  That option is very limited and you'll get better results on Facebook.

Facebook owns Instagram and they share the same ad platform.

The Instagram and Facebook ad platform is broken up into 3 parts.  The campaign, Ad Set, and Ads.

To run Instagram ads, you should set up a Facebook Business Manager account.
You can sign up for one here:
https://business.facebook.com/

If you want to create an effective video ad for Instagram, watch the how-to create Instagram ads video:
https://youtu.be/HDSjLy-X_Nw

You can run Instagram ads without this with a personal ad account, but this will help you expand in the future and keep things much more organized.

Once you create a Facebook business manager and fill out your information, you can go to your ad account and create a campaign.
Choose a campaign goal based on your intent.  You can choose reach or brand awareness if you are just trying to get eyeballs on your post.

Consideration campaigns are best for sending people to a website, to get video views, or simply as a lead generation tool.

Conversation campaigns really track the end results from your Instagram ads and are best for tracking sales.

Once you create your campaign, you'll select ad sets.  This is your targeting on who will see your ads.  You can choose by location, age, gender, interest, activity and the countless number of settings to laser focus your targeting.
You can also set your budget and duration of your Instagram ad, here.

The final step is creating your actual ad.  This is the ad creative from the title, to the description to photo or video that you'll use in your ad.

During the entire setup process, look at your potential reach.  This is the total number of people your Instagram ad can reach based on many factors through the setup process. You want this to not be too specific and not too broad.

Uq7eGGxLaus,The BEST way to run instagram ads in 2023,"This method works way better than just going right for the sale, and it’s all about the ad type, which is reels, and putting yourself in front of them over and over again. 

I call this my Omnipresent Reels Strategy. 😎

First, create one specific Reel ad to attract your ideal customers. It won’t look like an ad at all, it should just be content-based, on a topic that resonates with them, thats closely related to your offer. 

Then retarget anyone who watches it for over 3 seconds with a variety of Reels to hit different psychological triggers. Include a couple how-to, or tip reels, a couple advice-style reels, and a more inspirational one letting them know what’s possible. 

This approach works better than just throwing out a single ad and hoping it hits.

Keep the targeting wide open, and set the campaign engagement type to video views with a total budget of around $10 a day.

The easiest business I can help you start (free trial): https://www.skool.com/hormozi
Business owners: Want to scale faster? We provide in-person advisory for companies doing at least $1M per year: https://www.acquisition.com/workshop-yt

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $250,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

77AEJr_GW_s,How to increase followers on Instagram through Day 3🔥 #facebookads #instagramfollowers  💯,"If you want to increase instagram followers and want to reach correct followers, never use Boosting 🤫 Let me tell you why,

Through instagram boosting you don’t get detailed features to target your audience, whereas in facebook ads manager you have plethora of options to target specific audience and turn them into your followers through your content.

➡️ Choose campaign type as traffic

➡️ In conversion location choose instagram profile visit as option

If you don’t see this option, don’t worry, since its still in rolling out phase.

➡️ Connect your instagram and you can run ads on existing post.

PRO TIP: Do broad targeting since our main goal is to reach audience and YES make sure your content or ad creative is so attractive and unique that people want to interact with it.

This strategy will only work if your content is of that quality that it has the potential to convert people.

Also the results shown might not be same for everyone as It depends upon lot of factors such as ad creative and targeting

Also If you are a content creator who wants to increase their reach Organically I wouldn’t recommend this method, This is specifically for Brands and Businesses ⭐️

OVZvKtNW4C4,The NEW WAY To Get Instagram Followers with Ads,"Want me to MENTOR you to crush it with Facebook Ads? Go here: https://www.admasters365.com/start?el=YTLong-newwayIGfollowers1023-ment
Want my agency to do it for you? Go here: https://heathmedia.co.uk/done-for-you/?el=YTLong-newwayIGfollowers1023-fbdfy

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Ben Heath. I’m the founder and owner of https://heathmedia.co.uk/?el=YTLong-newwayIGfollowers1023-home a marketing agency that offers done-for-you services, coaching and educational resources, all with the objective of delivering exceptional marketing results for our clients and customers.

Over the past 9 years we’ve spent more than £50,000,000 on paid social ad campaigns generating more than £200,000,000 in revenue.

We’ve worked with more than 2,000 businesses directly from all over the world and in just about every niche you can think of. And we’ve helped educate hundreds of thousands of business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs.

How I got here…

17 yrs old: Started my first business selling wristbands with two school friends. I made $0.
18 yrs old: Started my first ecommerce business selling second hand video games. I made $0.
19 yrs old: Joined a network marketing company (would not recommend it). Was told I’d be rich if I signed up 8 people. I signed up 26 people in 3 months. I made $0.
21 yrs old: Dropped out of Bath University to start an app development company. I made less than $5,000 in 2 years!
23 yrs old: Started Heath Media, my marketing agency. I made $0 for the first 3 years.
26 yrs old: Went all in on building a personal brand within the marketing space. I passed $100k/year.
28 yrs old: My personal brand allowed me to attract the best talent in the world. Heath Media became an industry leading Meta ads agency, with an exceptional team and an excellent reputation. We crossed $1m/year.
31 yrs old: Today I teach over 800,000 business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs how to get insane results with digital marketing. Heath Media is a 50+ team of world class talent, working directly with over 400 clients every year. We’ve now crossed the $5m/year mark.

To all the struggling marketers and entrepreneurs… I was an entrepreneur for 9 years before I could even pay the bills with my own business. 5 years after that I have more success and more fun than I could have ever dreamed of.

It takes perseverance, analysis and learning from the right person.

If you took the time to read this far, you have what it takes to crush it with your marketing. 

I hope to help you speed up that journey and come along for the ride.

Keep going,

Ben

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Ben Heath. I’m the founder and owner of https://heathmedia.co.uk/?el=YTshorts-home a marketing agency that offers done-for-you services, coaching and educational resources, all with the objective of delivering exceptional marketing results for our clients and customers.

Over the past 9 years we’ve spent more than £50,000,000 on paid social ad campaigns generating more than £200,000,000 in revenue.

We’ve worked with more than 2,000 businesses directly from all over the world and in just about every niche you can think of. And we’ve helped educate hundreds of thousands of business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs.

How I got here…

17 yrs old: Started my first business selling wristbands with two school friends. I made $0.
18 yrs old: Started my first ecommerce business selling second hand video games. I made $0.
19 yrs old: Joined a network marketing company (would not recommend it). Was told I’d be rich if I signed up 8 people. I signed up 26 people in 3 months. I made $0.
21 yrs old: Dropped out of Bath University to start an app development company. I made less than $5,000 in 2 years!
23 yrs old: Started Heath Media, my marketing agency. I made $0 for the first 3 years.
26 yrs old: Went all in on building a personal brand within the marketing space. I passed $100k/year.
28 yrs old: My personal brand allowed me to attract the best talent in the world. Heath Media became an industry leading Meta ads agency, with an exceptional team and an excellent reputation. We crossed $1m/year.
31 yrs old: Today I teach over 800,000 business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs how to get insane results with digital marketing. Heath Media is a 50+ team of world class talent, working directly with over 400 clients every year. We’ve now crossed the $5m/year mark.

To all the struggling marketers and entrepreneurs… I was an entrepreneur for 9 years before I could even pay the bills with my own business. 5 years after that I have more success and more fun than I could have ever dreamed of.

It takes perseverance, analysis and learning from the right person.

If you took the time to read this far, you have what it takes to crush it with your marketing. 

I hope to help you speed up that journey and come along for the ride.

Keep going,

Ben

28 yrs old: My personal brand allowed me to attract the best talent in the world. Heath Media became an industry leading Meta ads agency, with an exceptional team and an excellent reputation. We crossed $1m/year.
31 yrs old: Today I teach over 800,000 business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs how to get insane results with digital marketing. Heath Media is a 50+ team of world class talent, working directly with over 400 clients every year. We’ve now crossed the $5m/year mark.

To all the struggling marketers and entrepreneurs… I was an entrepreneur for 9 years before I could even pay the bills with my own business. 5 years after that I have more success and more fun than I could have ever dreamed of.

It takes perseverance, analysis and learning from the right person.

If you took the time to read this far, you have what it takes to crush it with your marketing. 

I hope to help you speed up that journey and come along for the ride.

Keep going,

Ben

Want my agency to do it for you? Go here: https://heathmedia.co.uk/done-for-you/?el=YTshorts-fbdfy

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Ben Heath. I’m the founder and owner of https://heathmedia.co.uk/?el=YTshorts-home a marketing agency that offers done-for-you services, coaching and educational resources, all with the objective of delivering exceptional marketing results for our clients and customers.

Over the past 9 years we’ve spent more than £50,000,000 on paid social ad campaigns generating more than £200,000,000 in revenue.

We’ve worked with more than 2,000 businesses directly from all over the world and in just about every niche you can think of. And we’ve helped educate hundreds of thousands of business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs.

How I got here…

17 yrs old: Started my first business selling wristbands with two school friends. I made $0.
18 yrs old: Started my first ecommerce business selling second hand video games. I made $0.
19 yrs old: Joined a network marketing company (would not recommend it). Was told I’d be rich if I signed up 8 people. I signed up 26 people in 3 months. I made $0.
21 yrs old: Dropped out of Bath University to start an app development company. I made less than $5,000 in 2 years!
23 yrs old: Started Heath Media, my marketing agency. I made $0 for the first 3 years.
26 yrs old: Went all in on building a personal brand within the marketing space. I passed $100k/year.
28 yrs old: My personal brand allowed me to attract the best talent in the world. Heath Media became an industry leading Meta ads agency, with an exceptional team and an excellent reputation. We crossed $1m/year.
31 yrs old: Today I teach over 800,000 business owners, marketers and entrepreneurs how to get insane results with digital marketing. Heath Media is a 50+ team of world class talent, working directly with over 400 clients every year. We’ve now crossed the $5m/year mark.

To all the struggling marketers and entrepreneurs… I was an entrepreneur for 9 years before I could even pay the bills with my own business. 5 years after that I have more success and more fun than I could have ever dreamed of.

It takes perseverance, analysis and learning from the right person.

If you took the time to read this far, you have what it takes to crush it with your marketing. 

I hope to help you speed up that journey and come along for the ride.

Keep going,

Ben

Learn how to increase spending limit on Instagram ads by using a professional account, reviewing orders and payments, and managing payment methods in account center → meta pay. When you increase spending limit on Instagram ads, you can continue promoting without interruptions and keep your payments aligned with methods that support higher limits. This matters because some payment methods have limited features—switching or updating them helps remove limits so your promotions run smoothly. After you increase spending limit on Instagram ads, you can choose the method that fits, verify it inside meta pay, and use the help center if the option isn’t visible. Keeping a professional account active ensures the right tools appear, so your setup matches what Instagram provides without confusion.

_s2h7X-c2jE,SEO in 2025: How I'd Learn it if I Were Starting Over,"SEO has changed more in the last 2 years than the previous 10 combined and if I had to learn it from scratch in 2025, I wouldn’t start the way most people do.

Additional SEO Resources
► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsVTqzratPs
► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHW-izBq2-I

The old SEO playbook was to do keyword research, create content, get some backlinks, and you'd rank. It's more complicated than that now. 

AI has flooded the web with content, and Google has cracked down. Entire websites have disappeared from the search results overnight. But SEO isn’t dead... it’s just evolved.

In this video, I break down exactly what I’d do if I were learning SEO for the first time today — what still works, what doesn’t, how to use AI without sounding robotic, and the mindset shift most SEOs haven’t caught onto yet.

👀 You’ll learn:
► Why the old way of ""writing for Google"" is now a losing strategy
► The #1 skill every SEO beginner should build (but often skips)
► How to actually use AI tools without tanking your content
► The real reason Google still matters — and why it's only part of the game
► How to future-proof your SEO strategy (even if you’re just starting out)

39o0uYPo4jU,The New Rules of SEO (2026),"You're showing up in Google but your customers are making decisions somewhere else.

TikTok. Reddit. Amazon. ChatGPT. These are the new ""search engines"" and most marketers haven't caught up. In this video, I break down one of the biggest shifts in internet history: why ranking no longer equals revenue and what to do instead.

If your traffic looks fine but conversions are flat... you might be stuck in what I call The Google Trap. You're optimizing for visibility while customers are deciding in totally different places.

This isn't about doing more. It's about showing up where decisions actually happen.

You'll learn why 73% of modern ""search"" happens outside of Google, how consumers now make decisions across TikTok, Reddit, ChatGPT, Amazon and more, what ""Search Everywhere Optimization"" really means and how to do it, the key difference between visibility and validation, and why being trusted on 1-2 platforms beats being visible on 10.

Whether you're a founder, CMO, or just trying to get marketing results again, this is the new playbook. Watch now and start showing up where your customers actually choose.",Neil Patel,2025-07-23T12:00:06Z,171785,6043,423,youtube seo

39o0uYPo4jU,The New Rules of SEO (2026),"You're showing up in Google but your customers are making decisions somewhere else.

TikTok. Reddit. Amazon. ChatGPT. These are the new ""search engines"" and most marketers haven't caught up. In this video, I break down one of the biggest shifts in internet history: why ranking no longer equals revenue and what to do instead.

If your traffic looks fine but conversions are flat... you might be stuck in what I call The Google Trap. You're optimizing for visibility while customers are deciding in totally different places.

This isn't about doing more. It's about showing up where decisions actually happen.

You'll learn why 73% of modern ""search"" happens outside of Google, how consumers now make decisions across TikTok, Reddit, ChatGPT, Amazon and more, what ""Search Everywhere Optimization"" really means and how to do it, the key difference between visibility and validation, and why being trusted on 1-2 platforms beats being visible on 10.

Whether you're a founder, CMO, or just trying to get marketing results again, this is the new playbook. Watch now and start showing up where your customers actually choose.",Neil Patel,2025-07-23T12:00:06Z,171785,6043,423,youtube seo

6 YouTube Video SEO Tips:

1. Find topics with high search volume through keyword research. We recommend using VidIQ’s free Chrome plugin and Ahrefs YouTube Keyword Tool (both free).

2. Tell YouTube what your video is about. By using the keyword and other similar phrases in the video title, description, and tags, you help YouTube’s algorithm understand what your video is about so it knows who to initially show your video to.

3. Get people to click on your videos. Click through rate (CTR) is one of the most important YouTube metrics. Check out our YouTube thumbnail video listed above for help creating videos that people click on helping you get more video views.

4. Keep people watching videos on YouTube. Audience retention is very important for your videos. If you can retain your audience and get lots of watch time on each of your videos, YouTube will show your videos to more people.

5. Get people to interact with your content. When you get someone to like, comment or subscribe while watching one of your videos, that sends a signal to YouTube that people enjoy your content. If it’s clear that people enjoy consuming your content, YouTube will find more people to show your videos to.

6. Drive traffic to your videos within the first 24-48 hours. We share our videos on the YouTube community tab and our email list within a few hours of publishing a new video. We also share our videos on all of your social media channels such as Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Pinterest.",TheFigCo,2020-11-25T21:51:02Z,63000,3490,37,youtube seo

J4UC-xVaKoM,YouTube SEO Isn’t Just About Keywords,"Ranking on YouTube takes more than stuffing tags or tweaking your title. It's about how long people watch, how often they click, and whether your content actually delivers on what the searcher wants. High watch time and retention are your real SEO engines. If people click but bounce, the algorithm stops pushing. Focus on relevance, structure, and holding attention to grow consistently.",Rod Agatep,2025-07-20T19:02:56Z,103,1,0,youtube seo

SEO isn’t just about ranking on Google anymore. Customers are searching billions of times a day across YouTube, TikTok, Amazon, LinkedIn, Reddit — and now AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. If you’re not showing up there, you’re invisible where buying decisions are being made.

You’ll learn how to:

Does Google even look at that info to determine how to rank a video? It turns out that, while those things may indirectly influence how a video ranks, Google doesn't directly factor in those signals. In this video I explain why they don't and how they still may influence your video's SEO value.

I’m sure you’ve noticed that videos have been appearing more and more in Google’s search results. In fact, SEO statistics show that video carousels nearly doubled in the SERPs in 2017.

This is why you should be focusing on video SEO. 

What is video SEO? 

Video SEO is different from YouTube SEO. Video SEO is the process of increasing visibility and rankings in search engines like Google. Whereas YouTube SEO is the process of increasing visibility and rankings in YouTube search. The good news: properly optimized videos 

The good news is that properly optimized videos for Google can also rank in YouTube and vice versa, with just a few additional things.

So, how do you rank your YouTube videos on Google? 

The first step is to find video topics with ranking and traffic potential.  

Google ranks content that best serves a user’s query. And generally speaking, if videos are ranking high or are prominent in the SERPs, it’s a sign that creating a video on this topic has the potential to get views from Google.

And in this video, you’ll learn three ways to find video topics with both ranking and traffic potential. 

Step 2 is to create an optimized video. 

You probably already know the basics of video optimization. Your videos need to engage your audience, i.e., long watch times, high audience retention, and boast-worthy session watch times. 

But something a lot of creators forget is that the Internet is more or less text-based. So if Google, YouTube or any other search engine can’t interpret the text attached to your video, then you’ll never rank your videos on YouTube or Google. 

If you want to optimize your videos (and not just for engagement), you’ll have to give as much context as possible to search engines. And the way you do that boils down to the words spoken in the video, matching visuals, and metadata. 

While they’re easy to implement, they do require some planning. And in this tutorial, you’ll learn some strategies on how to do this. 

The third step is to add closed captions to your instructional videos. 

Remember: we want to help YouTube and Google understand the contents of our video as much as possible.

And since the words that are spoken can easily be transcribed to text, this is probably the best and easiest way to add context to your video. 

You’ll learn how to do this in the video. 

Step 4 is to create an enticing thumbnail.

It’s no secret that great thumbnails lead to more clicks. So, you’ll learn a couple of cool tips on how to make a compelling thumbnail that gets viewers to click. 

Finally, the last step is to add timestamps to your videos. This can help you get the “key moments” feature on Google.

Key moments is a new SERP feature was released in September 2019. Here’s Google explanation about this:

“When you search for things like how-to videos that have multiple steps, or long videos like speeches or a documentary, Search will provide links to key moments within the video based on timestamps provided by content creators.”

How do you capture “key moments” with your video? You’ll learn how in this tutorial. 

To conclude, it’s estimated that video will represent 82% of ALL IP traffic in 2021. The fact that video is starting to dominate Google’s SERP is a good indicator that it’s time to up your video SEO game.

1:18 Find video topics that rank and bring traffic
5:13 Optimize your video for organic rankings

DvwS7cV9GmQ,SEO For Beginners: A Basic Search Engine Optimization Tutorial for Higher Google Rankings,"New to SEO? This tutorial shows you the basics of doing search engine optimization for your website to rank high in Google. 

Complete SEO Course for Beginners: Learn to Rank #1 in Google ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsVTqzratPs

First, what is SEO and how does it work?

SEO stands for search engine optimization. By definition, it is the process of optimizing your website and webpages to get “free”, “organic” traffic from search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing.

As a business owner, blogger, or website owner, your job is two-fold: 

First, you need to make it easy for search engines to understand what your page is about and create content that matches what we call, the “searcher’s intent.” 

Second, you need to show Google and other search engines that your pages are ‘worthy’ of ranking.

In this video, Sam Oh teaches the a 101 into the world of search engine optimization.

There are plenty of clear examples and some basic (yet powerful) SEO tips to optimize a brand new website to rank #1 on Google (step-by-step).

The techniques that are taught in this SEO training include: 

1. Keyword research 
By doing keyword research, you can see the average number of times someone searches for a specific keyword phrase in Google each month.

Often times, the query that you think will be the most popular is often far from the truth.

Using tools like Ahrefs Keywords Explorer (https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer), you’ll learn how to use the “parent topic” of a term to determine the best keywords to target for your pages.

You’ll also learn what not to do (ie. keyword stuffing). 

Keyword research gives you clues on the language you should use to let both Google and potential customers know what our page is about.

There are a few vivid examples in here to illustrate the best practices on how to do keyword research. If you want to sharpen your keyword research skills, I highly recommend watching this series on doing keyword research in 2018 and beyond. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zLBu_NfOaQ&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2tIF-QrFD854Mnb8D4Av5vx

2. On-page SEO
On-page SEO is the process of optimizing web pages with the intention to rank high in Google. If you want to rank #1 on Google, then your on-page SEO will need to be right on.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn 4 simple, yet highly effective tips to ensure you are following Google SEO best practices. Having optimized web pages will set the foundation for your success in search engine optimization.

It will help Google understand what your content is about and help your customers find you.

A few of the basic tips include:

- Title tags 
- Meta descriptions
- Heading tags (or H1 tags)
- keyword usage
- content creation
- competitor analysis

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWiNz-7gZ24&list=PLvJ_dXFSpd2s-OV4MiYXV8yhUjKYtW_bm&index=6

3. Off-page SEO
Off-page SEO is often referred to as link building.

Link building is the process of getting other websites to link to your web pages. 

Basically, links act as “votes” or other people vouching for your website.

Backlinks work in a similar way that you would refer your friend to buy a product from your favorite store because you’ve tried it, used it, and loved it.

In general, the more quality backlinks you can get from relevant pages, the higher you’ll rank in Google.

Sam will show you how to find backlink opportunities and the key technique that SEOs use to build links, which is through email outreach.

I highly recommend watching our video series on competitor backlink analysis and link building here:

BJhTePXFvGo,"How To Go From Zero to 100,000 Subscribers on YouTube - YouTube Unlocked - Module 1 - Lesson 1","I'm really excited today because I'm going to teach you how to go from zero to 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. This is a two-week course, eight videos in total, actually six videos in total, sorry about that, and I'm going to end up breaking down everything you need to know about YouTube to start generating more traffic. The videos aren't too long. You'll get quite a bit of value from. All you have to do is follow along. 

RESOURCES & LINKS:

____________________________________________

Now, the key with YouTube is you have to create quality content that users want. If you don't, you won't get the subscribers, the traffic in the long run, and more importantly, all those video views won't convert into more leads or more sales. Hence the quality of the content is super important. 

When you think about YouTube, there's been quite a bit of evolution that's happened over the years, especially in the early years. It was founded in February 2005, started out as a dating website, believe it or not, then it transformed into a free video hosting platform. The first video ever uploaded was titled ""Me at the Zoo"". Most videos uploaded were short amateur videos, and Nike was the first major brand to post on YouTube. 

I have millions and millions of views in total. Heck, I'm getting over a million views a month. I don't even know how much watch time I'm at now, but my subscriber count's growing and growing, and I'm on my way to a million-plus subscribers. Not there yet, but getting pretty close. And if I can do this in a boring B2B space that most people don't care about, even though I don't find it boring and I do love marketing, in essence, anyone can do it. 

It's the second most popular social platform after Facebook as well. And when you think about YouTube, 90% of people say they discover new brands or products on YouTube. That's huge. And people are watching videos so much that every day, people watch 1 billion, literally 1 billion hours of videos on YouTube and they generate billions of views. That's a ton of engagement and those people are captivated. 

It's hard to build that much traffic. Hence you want to be on YouTube, because it allows you to tap into this whole new audience and generate more and more sales. 

Now, this course focuses on that 2 billion people that are on YouTube, and I'm going to show you the exact strategies, the hacks, the steps you need to take where you can leverage content on that platform and go from zero to 100,000 subscribers. 

If you already have more than 100,000 subscribers, like a million, this course probably isn't a good fit for you. It breaks down everything you need to know to get to that first 100,000 mark. 

And you need to first understand how YouTube works to be on your way so you can get there. With YouTube, you got to build your marketing strategy, create your channel, create videos of course, then optimize the videos for SEO. This is my favorite part. 

Most people rely on the suggestion videos. SEO can bring you very consistent traffic. Then you need to understand their analytics, and of course, you need to grow in the long term. And there's all these steps that are going to help you get that way. And I'm going to break them down over the next two weeks where I teach you how to go step by step to 100,000 followers. 

So I want you to go to neilpatel.com/training, where you can find all of these lessons and handouts and all that material. All you have to do is click on YouTube Unlocked and you'll see all the material there. 

Make sure you take your time. There's no rush. This course doesn't expire. It's free, doesn't cost a dime. Just take your time. If you don't have the time today to do it, you can always do it tomorrow or another day. 

And by the end of the course, you're going to know how to build amazing content and you're going to be able to grow your following to 100,000 subscribers and beyond. 

Thank you very much. If you enjoy this, make sure you subscribe. That way you can get the rest of the lessons, and when I mean subscribed, I'm talking about subscribing on Facebook, YouTube, or wherever you're watching this. 

It doesn't cost a dollar to watch this course or any of these lessons. It's fully free. If you have any questions, leave a comment. Tell your friends about this course. 

We're here to help you grow and succeed. Thank you for your time.

NY3y0V9UDwM,YouTube SEO Tips to Rank Your Videos #1,"Learn how to rank YouTube videos fast using our 7-step YouTube SEO process. These EXACT tips have increased our views by nearly 400% in 7.5 months.

***************************************
Video Marketing Resources

YouTube Keyword Research: How to Get More Views Consistently ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAuM2nQb_P8

How to Edit YouTube Videos for High Engagement ► https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5EOWffq-gk

Full YouTube SEO Blog Post ► https://ahrefs.com/blog/youtube-seo/

***************************************

In a short period of time, we were able to rank our videos for some of the most popular keywords in our industry: 

#1 - Local SEO
#1 - Ecommerce SEO
#2 - SEO
#2 - search engine optimization

And the list goes on.

The best part about video SEO is that you don’t need to have a massive channel to rank #1. You just need to entertain and engage your audience better than your competitors.

Follow everything from the basics and move to the advanced tips, which should help you rank your videos higher and faster.

First, what is YouTube SEO?

It’s the process of optimizing your videos, playlists, and channel to rank high in YouTube’s organic search results for a given search query.

Our data-driven strategy begins with YouTube Keyword Research.

A couple of free tools you can use are YouTube suggest, paired with Google trends. 

This is a great way to gauge a keywords popularity against other keywords. However, since Google trends shows relative popularity, it may not be the best way to find true search volumes.

Another tool you can use is Ahrefs’ Keywords Explorer, which shows you search volume and clicks data for any keyword on YouTube.

This tool works perfectly when paired with Tubebuddy (most tagged videos section) or vidIQ (related keywords feature). 

While YouTube is the second largest search engine, you can also use other tools like Google search and Ahrefs’ Content Explorer to rank your YouTube videos on the first page of Google search.

In fact, Google is our second largest source of external referral traffic.

This video covers all of the tactics, tips, and strategies to rank videos on Google.

The second step is to identify search intent.

Search intent represents the reason behind a searcher’s query. To analyze search intent, just type your keyword into the YouTube search bar and see which videos are ranking in the top 3 positions. 

Take note of the format and angles other creators are taking and follow suit with your own video. 

Step 3 is the most important. And that’s to create a high-retention video. 

Engagement is arguably the most important ranking factor in YouTube’s algorithm. If you can’t engage your audience, then you probably won’t rank.

This can be measured in YouTube Studio analytics by looking at the audience retention graph. You’ll learn EXACTLY how we consistently create high-retention videos from our planning to editing processes.

Step 4 is to do on-page video optimizations.

This boils down to the title, description, thumbnail, and meta data like YouTube tags. You’ll learn how to optimize your videos following YouTube’s best practices.

Step 5 are in-video optimizations.

YouTube allows you to add subtitles or closed captions (CC) to your videos. This helps bring context to your videos which can be helpful when trying to rank your videos. 

You’ll also learn a couple engagement hacks using YouTube cards and end-screens. 

Step 6 is to publish and promote your video

Whether you have a massive audience or tiny one, you’ll learn how to promote your videos to get more views fast.

Step 7 is to optimize your videos (and channel) for session watch time. 

Session watch time is the total time a viewer watches videos on YouTube without leaving the platform.

YouTube said on their creator blog that they use this metric as a ranking factor in their search and discovery algorithm.

Our channel playlist hack will help you do just that.

Td6ZO1MGOeY,Comment faire du Youtube SEO de manière efficace ?,"Aujourd'hui, Christophe Vidal vous montre comment utiliser le SEO pour YouTube et il vous donnera quelques recommandations pour optimiser vos vidéos dans la plateforme avec des outils SEO pour Youtube. Vous aimez cette vidéo ? Abonnez-vous ! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqiekrYGsqJKXpywe4pdp1g?sub_confirmation=1 

Pour comprendre l'importance d'une stratégie SEO pour YouTube, il faut se rappeler que YouTube n'est pas un réseau social, comme Facebook, Instagram ou TikTok, mais un moteur de recherche.
 
Les vidéos partagées ici durent bien plus longtemps que quelques jours ou semaines. Elles peuvent donner des résultats sur plusieurs années. Et comme les gens se rendent sur YouTube pour rechercher des choses qu'ils veulent voir, notre contenu doit être optimisé pour apparaître dans les résultats de recherche.
 
Et c'est là qu'intervient le SEO, qui est l'acronyme de Search Engine Optimization (ou optimisation pour les moteurs de recherche). Nous devons développer nos vidéos pour que YouTube les diffuse auprès du plus grand nombre de personnes possible. Et les gens les plus susceptibles de nous regarder.

It helps ensure your site appears correctly in search results, providing you with detailed reports on search queries, clicks, and indexing status. Additionally, Ahrefs stands out for its powerful backlink analysis and competitive research capabilities. By giving you a clear view of your site's link profile and competitor strategies, Ahrefs enables you to develop effective link-building campaigns and stay ahead in the competitive SEO landscape.

SEMrush is another indispensable tool, renowned for its comprehensive keyword research and tracking features. It allows you to optimize your content for better visibility by identifying high-performing keywords and tracking their rankings. Finally, Yoast SEO is a must-have for WordPress users, offering an intuitive interface for optimizing on-page SEO. It makes it easier to enhance your site's search engine performance by guiding you through the process of improving meta tags, content readability, and overall SEO best practices.

 Você quer ter mais visualizações nos seus vídeos e crescer o seu canal no YouTube? O segredo é ranquear bem o seu vídeo nas pesquisas, e isso é feito através do SEO para YouTube.
O SEO é uma sigla que significa otimização para mecanismos de busca. No YouTube utilizamos um conjunto de técnicas com o objetivo de melhorar o desempenho de um vídeo.
Uma dessas técnicas é a pesquisa de Tags através da ferramenta vidIQ, que é uma extensão para o Chrome. As tags são responsáveis por ajudar o seu vídeo a ser encontrado nas pesquisas no YouTube. Caso você consiga ranquear bem essas tags, seu vídeo terá muitas visualizações e seu canal irá crescer.
Hoje quem vai passar esse conteúdo de como fazer SEO para YouTube não serei eu, vai ser o Jácson. É ele que trabalha diretamente com isso e tem ajudado muito o canal a crescer. Cerca de 4 meses atrás o canal estava com 100 inscritos e ontem batemos a marca de 10 mil com mais de 370 mil visualizações.

Simply export your subtitles, drag the SRT into the chat window and ask for “SEO optimised YouTube metadata”. In just a few seconds you’ll get:

An attention-grabbing title tailored to your topic

A concise, keyword-rich description ready for your upload

A set of comma-separated tags to improve reach

I also cover how to tweak the prompt if the first result isn’t quite right and why this method works for podcasts, YouTube videos or any sound-based content. Save time on your metadata so you can focus on creating more content.

BJhTePXFvGo,"How To Go From Zero to 100,000 Subscribers on YouTube - YouTube Unlocked - Module 1 - Lesson 1","I'm really excited today because I'm going to teach you how to go from zero to 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. This is a two-week course, eight videos in total, actually six videos in total, sorry about that, and I'm going to end up breaking down everything you need to know about YouTube to start generating more traffic. The videos aren't too long. You'll get quite a bit of value from. All you have to do is follow along. 

RESOURCES & LINKS:

____________________________________________

Now, the key with YouTube is you have to create quality content that users want. If you don't, you won't get the subscribers, the traffic in the long run, and more importantly, all those video views won't convert into more leads or more sales. Hence the quality of the content is super important. 

When you think about YouTube, there's been quite a bit of evolution that's happened over the years, especially in the early years. It was founded in February 2005, started out as a dating website, believe it or not, then it transformed into a free video hosting platform. The first video ever uploaded was titled ""Me at the Zoo"". Most videos uploaded were short amateur videos, and Nike was the first major brand to post on YouTube. 

I have millions and millions of views in total. Heck, I'm getting over a million views a month. I don't even know how much watch time I'm at now, but my subscriber count's growing and growing, and I'm on my way to a million-plus subscribers. Not there yet, but getting pretty close. And if I can do this in a boring B2B space that most people don't care about, even though I don't find it boring and I do love marketing, in essence, anyone can do it. 

It's the second most popular social platform after Facebook as well. And when you think about YouTube, 90% of people say they discover new brands or products on YouTube. That's huge. And people are watching videos so much that every day, people watch 1 billion, literally 1 billion hours of videos on YouTube and they generate billions of views. That's a ton of engagement and those people are captivated. 

It's hard to build that much traffic. Hence you want to be on YouTube, because it allows you to tap into this whole new audience and generate more and more sales. 

Now, this course focuses on that 2 billion people that are on YouTube, and I'm going to show you the exact strategies, the hacks, the steps you need to take where you can leverage content on that platform and go from zero to 100,000 subscribers. 

If you already have more than 100,000 subscribers, like a million, this course probably isn't a good fit for you. It breaks down everything you need to know to get to that first 100,000 mark. 

And you need to first understand how YouTube works to be on your way so you can get there. With YouTube, you got to build your marketing strategy, create your channel, create videos of course, then optimize the videos for SEO. This is my favorite part. 

Most people rely on the suggestion videos. SEO can bring you very consistent traffic. Then you need to understand their analytics, and of course, you need to grow in the long term. And there's all these steps that are going to help you get that way. And I'm going to break them down over the next two weeks where I teach you how to go step by step to 100,000 followers. 

So I want you to go to neilpatel.com/training, where you can find all of these lessons and handouts and all that material. All you have to do is click on YouTube Unlocked and you'll see all the material there. 

Make sure you take your time. There's no rush. This course doesn't expire. It's free, doesn't cost a dime. Just take your time. If you don't have the time today to do it, you can always do it tomorrow or another day. 

And by the end of the course, you're going to know how to build amazing content and you're going to be able to grow your following to 100,000 subscribers and beyond. 

Thank you very much. If you enjoy this, make sure you subscribe. That way you can get the rest of the lessons, and when I mean subscribed, I'm talking about subscribing on Facebook, YouTube, or wherever you're watching this. 

It doesn't cost a dollar to watch this course or any of these lessons. It's fully free. If you have any questions, leave a comment. Tell your friends about this course. 

We're here to help you grow and succeed. Thank you for your time.

Learn how to become a full-time, passion-led Creatorpreneur - https://www.rockporch.com

If you’ve been stuck under 10,000 subscribers and wondering why your YouTube channel isn’t growing — this video is your reality check. 🎯

I’m breaking down the truth about YouTube growth in 2026 — what actually matters, what’s completely outdated, and where small creators should really focus their time. Forget the “gurus” and keyword hacks. The YouTube algorithm is smarter than ever, and success now comes down to titles, thumbnails, and hooks — not metadata or keyword stuffing.

I’ll show you:
✅ How to master your YouTube intros and visual hooks
✅ Why YouTube SEO ≠ keyword research anymore
✅ The secret to crafting clickable, curiosity-based titles
✅ How to use your B-roll, storytelling, and vulnerability to stand out
✅ Why Shorts, over-editing, and “posting everywhere” can actually hurt your growth

Whether you’re hiking, filming from your van, or creating fitness content — this video will help you stop wasting time on strategies that don’t work and double down on what does.",RockPorch,2025-11-06T18:03:02Z,54,3,1,youtube seo

1:10 Find topics with high search volume
6:42 Tell YouTube what your video is about
8:42 Get people to click on your videos (CTR)
9:38 Keep people watching videos on YouTube
11:34 Get people to interact with your content
12:56 Embed your videos on your website
13:57 Drive traffic to your videos in the first 24 hours

7 YouTube Video SEO Tips:

1. Find topics with high search volume through keyword research. You can see how I performed keyword research for my recent Canva Tutorial for Beginners video by using VidIQ and Ahrefs.

2. Tell YouTube what your video is about. By using the keyword and other similar phrases in the video title, description, and tags, you help YouTube’s algorithm understand what your video is about so it knows who to initially show your video to.

3. Get people to click on your videos. Click through rate (CTR) is one of the most important YouTube metrics. No one can watch your video if they don’t first click on it. Spend a lot of time on your video thumbnail and title so when people see your video in search results or suggested video they want to click on your video.

4. Keep people watching videos on YouTube. Watch time is as important at CTR. You need to keep people on YouTube watching your video and ideally additional videos before ending their YouTube session. You can’t see this in YouTube Studio / YouTube analytics but YouTube measures session time (how long someone spends on YouTube in 1 session). Use cards and end screens to recommend other content to keep viewers watching more of your content back to back. If you can help YouTube keep viewers on YouTube longer, you’ll be rewarded with more views on your videos. 

5. Get people to interact with your content. When you get someone to like, comment, or subscribe while watching one of your videos, that sends a signal to YouTube that people enjoy your content. If it’s clear that people enjoy consuming your content, YouTube will find more people to show your videos to.

6. Embed your videos on your website. A study done by Briggsby (https://www.briggsby.com/reverse-engineering-youtube-search) found that the more links or embeds a video had, the higher it ranked in YouTube search results. Create blog posts on your website and embed your YouTube videos.

7. Drive as much traffic to your videos within the first 24-48 hours of publishing. Share your videos in the community tab if you have over 1,000 subscribers. Share your YouTube videos to your email list. Share your videos on all of your social media channels such as Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Pinterest. Also, you can share your videos on forums such as Quora or Reddit.",TheFigCo,2020-10-26T13:10:20Z,5412,226,23,youtube seo

Para crecer en YouTube, necesitas tener más visitas en tus videos de YouTube, por eso en este video te voy a decir qué debes tomar en cuenta para que tus videos lleguen a tu audiencia adecuada y tengan el impacto deseado. Obtener más visitas en YouTube no es tan difícil si sigues la estrategia adecuada para crecer en YouTube.

Si se te dificulta tener vistas en tus videos, lo primero que debes entender es que la métrica en la que te debes enfocar es en el CTR (El número de clics que obtiene un enlance, en este caso tus videos de YouTube). Debes incrementar tu CTR, aquí te diré cómo hacer esto para tener más vistas en tus videos.

El thumbnail es un elemento esencial para que las personas de click sobre tu video. Es la imagen que destaca y el primer contacto que la gente tiene con tu video. Cuando tu imagen miniatura es más llamativa por sobre los otros videos, es más probable que las personas den click a tu video, además de las keywords que debes usar para hacer saber a tu audiencia que lo que está en tu video es el contenido que ellos buscan. Cuando tu thumbnail empiece a destacar, harás que tu contenido tenga mayor CTR, o sea, mayor visitas en tus videos.

Otro punto a tomar en cuenta de tus videos, es el título, este debe contener las keywords adecuadas, o sea las palabras que las personas están buscando respecto al tema de tu video. Para aumentar la vista de tus videos, es elemental que puedas posicionar tu video con palabras claves o keywords. Existen herramientas como VidIQ, que ayudan a saber qué palabras usar para tus tags y títulos de videos.

El siguiente punto a tomar en cuenta para tener más visitas en tus videos, es el watchtime. Éste es muy importante pues te indica, cuánta retención tienen tus videos y esto para YouTube es muy importante pues le indica si tu contenido es de valor para las personas. Puedes mejorar tus videos de YouTube, al estructurar el contenido e ir directo a la idea o al tema principal. No uses introducciones muy largas, pues harás que las personas se salgan del video y por ende tu canal no crezca de manera rápida.",TheFigCo en Español,2020-11-29T21:39:32Z,122963,8805,119,youtube seo

zxqYs2TGmG4,Laundry Detergent Sheets Reviewed #laundry #productreviews,"I'm a 4th generation dry cleaner who reviews laundry detergents and detergent sheets (yes literally all of them) are NOT worth it!!!

While laundry detergent sheets may seem like a dream come true, they fall flat where it matters most—cleaning your clothes. Despite the sustainable packaging, they perform poorly, cost more than you'd expect, and heavily lean on your desire to be eco-friendly without delivering real results. I don’t recommend them. In my opinion they are the result of marketing greenwashing preying on your good hearted sustainable mindset. 

I've tested about a dozen brands; they're all trash. I tested big name brands, viral brands, small business brands and not a single one is worth it. They clean poorly, are pretty expensive, and have very few benefits.

If you're looking for sustainable packaging, look for powdered products in cardboard. If it's portability you're after, give pods a try. Also the Tide Evo tile is a fantastic product that excels in all of these categories. 

I hope you find this review helpful!

🟡 About This Video:

There are many routes you can take to become an Amazon product tester that will get you free or discounted Amazon products.

In some cases, you can even get paid from Amazon for reviewing products that customers end up purchasing through your efforts. 

This is called affiliate marketing and is a program conducted through the Amazon Associates and Influencer program. 

If you decide that being an Amazon product tester is something you want to do full-time, then consider applying to these Amazon Creator paid programs (more about that later on!).

It’s one neat way to get paid for your Amazon product reviews and earn a side hustle income!

What is an Amazon Product Tester?

An Amazon product tester reviews products sold on Amazon. In general, product testers do this in order to obtain free or heavily discounted Amazon products. Although, you are not required to leave a review in order to receive these products.

It’s important to note that an Amazon product tester job is not a position offered directly by Amazon. 

Being aware of this will help you avoid product tester job scams that are posted and promoted all over social media.

Instead many third-party companies, such as Rebaid, will partner with Amazon sellers to provide product awareness for newly launched Amazon products. 

Amazon sellers benefit greatly from these services by getting sales to their recently released product on Amazon. 

Additionally, it helps sellers generate their first few Amazon product reviews, which is crucial to their success on Amazon.

You benefit by getting Amazon products for free or at a significant discount to test out these new products on Amazon.

osaExOh7geI,Speed review of popular skin care products | dermatologist opines,"Explanation here 👇

✅Cetaphil gentle cleanser :
Works for most skin types also in sensitive skin. 
If you have oily skin then use cetaphil oc for better results 

❌The ordinary AHA BHA peeling solution 
This is a very popular product but not for Indian skin. The concentration of acids is too high for our skin type and climate. Whenever you undergo a peeling session with this, you have to follow strict sun protection for atleast a week along with intense moisturization. Otherwise there will be dark spots left behind. I will not recommend 
👩‍⚕️ replace with a 10% -AHA peeling solution 

✅Minimalist SPF 50 sunscreen
 This is a good sunscreen if you like a light weight non sticky sunscreen with no white cast. It has spf 50 and PA 4+ . UV filters are uvinul T, avobenzone, octocrylene and titanium dioxide. 

❌Minimalist nonapeptide + AHA 
It is marketed for lightening underarms darkness and reducing odour. It didn’t work in odour at all. 
👩‍⚕️better to use a benzoyl peroxide soap for odour. 

❌Auravedic kumkumadi toner 
Toner is general is completely avoidable but these ones don’t work 
👩‍⚕️look for greens tea or rose water in your toner 

❌Biotique sun shield sunscreen ultra protective lotion 
Not a fan of the product, the texture,  the ingredients  and how it feels. 
👩‍⚕️there are many better sunscreen 

✅Fixderma Shadow SPF 50+ 
A good sunscreen for those with oily acne prone skin. It has a light gel based texture. Leaves no white cast 

✅Forest essential facial tonic mist 
Those who like toners or mist, this is a good refreshing option which actually makes skin look better.

dbdnaUIcNvU,I Became an AMAZON Product Reviewer and Here's What Happened,"I use to give out freebies review!
And I actually enjoy reviewing products...

But when i found out that I can get paid doing it, why not make money and enjoy at the same time.

As a beginner and doing this just for a few months, I was able to cover our grocery budget and some of our bills…

And I also realized that I just built myself a passive income business...
my commission doesn’t stop even when I'm sleeping.

And you can do this too!

❌ You don’t need to be an Influencer
❌ You don’t need a huge following
❌ No need to post on any social media
❌ You don’t even have to show your face

Here’s how you can learn the same strategy that got me approved…

2aY5LMFTnRk,"Misen Carbon Nonstick Sold $2M in Preorders, Is It Worth the Hype?","Thanks to GoDaddy for sponsoring this video! Head to https://godaddy.yt.link/sonY2vV to get started with GoDaddy Airo® today.

Does the Misen Carbon Nonstick pan live up to the hype? Misen claims it cooks like nonstick, lasts forever, resists scratches from metal utensils, won’t rust, and never needs seasoning. To put those claims to the test, I cooked eggs, simmered tomatoes, checked for rust, scraped it with heavy metal tools, and measured heat conduction, retention, and warping. In this review, I reveal which promises held up, and which ones didn’t.

Bright colors, fun design, way different from the typical boring clear cases and black bricks. But once you get past the looks, the TORRAS Ostand Q3 Air has a long way to go when it comes to actual protection. Let’s talk about it.

TORRAS Ostand Q3 Air for iPhone 17 Pro Case with 360 Magnetic Stand, Fit for MagSafe, Mil-Grade Drop Tested, Camera Control Button, Shockproof Phone Case Review

-i don't even know where to start with this case design wise
-there's giant air pockets along the top and bottom of the case
-the PC back has a frosted finish that has a bit of tack to it
-the edge has 2-3 types of TPU I think
-this frosted stuff, the air pocket stuff and the bright blue stuff
-lots of stuff
-Torras has added a ton of prints to the case which seem extraneous
-prints like this corner thing that looks like the feet you'd find on other cases
-this case has this annoying stand build into it
-I really don't like this
-BUT with Torras newer cases, they have a rotating stand which works way better
-now visually, you'd think this case is super grippy
-it has a TPU edge
-there's these grip strips
-BUT the reality is the case is super slick
-almost handles like a wet bar of soap
-the only saving grace are the air pockets that have a tacky finish to it
-case is going to add 53g to your iPhone, which is pretty average
-bulk wise, going to increase the size of your iPhone by 71%
-alright, for drop protection,
-Torras claims this case has a 100% rebound rate
-so somehow these plastic airbags defy the laws of physics
-or Torras has magically developed a system were there is no energy loss?

-the intial impact at the corners at 3ft was 11.0N
-that's 14% higher than average
-now despite the airbags, the case didn't rotate as much as I thought
-because the rotation rate was average
-when it came to settling down, the rate was 55% faster than average
-and because of that the total force going into the iPhone was a hair below average
-so is this a good result?
-I don't think so
-a good case dampens the drop, the air bags on this case act like springs
-the only thing the air bags are good for is preventing the case from looking damaged which is what most case manufacturers are going for

-for face drops
-the edges of this case have very little flex
-so it passes
-intial impact is 42% lower
-settling rate is 34% better
-and the total force is 14% lower for face first drops

-marvelous!

-for the camera lump, Torras only has the PC back around it
-though it looks like it's multiple layers
-which helps because
-the initial I'm pact is 30% lower
-but because it its a PC back, the settling rate is 7% worse
-BUT the overall force is 15% lower than average

-so the case is decent for face and camera lump drops
-but given corner drops are the most common, the high initial impact for each drop is worrisome for me
-corners on the case are big at 3.7mm
-mind you most of the corner is air
-the back is 2.9mm thick which is a hair above average 
-for rigidity
-this case was average
-which is neat to see because the stand is baked into the back
-for magsafe, takes 7.1N to pull, 6.9 to push
-that's 30% below average
-these magnets are so weak that I'd be wary using a simple wallet on it...
-maybe I got a bad case because what I see is far from whatever 18N marketing fluff torras touts
-case has flow thru buttons 
-there's a bit of lateral wiggle that's a bit more noticeable compared to other Torras cases
-prot cutout can handle any size cable
-and is pretty comfortable for the pinky
-screen access is great because of the super low edges",MobileReviewsEh,2025-11-21T16:30:10Z,10033,505,112,product reviews

pjYtoZub3c4,"Complete 6 Months Later | LG C5 OLED 65"" 4K TV Review ","For complete transparency, this is a reupload video as the previous video was trimmed by youtube setting due to copyright clip from Lords of the ring movie scene. 

The LG C5 OLED evo (65”) still delivers stunning picture quality, perfect blacks, smooth gaming, and premium design after six months. webOS remains polished, with no burn-in observed. Its only drawbacks are lower brightness than Mini-LED rivals and reflections in bright rooms, but it remains a top cinematic choice.

Das8fVDGPL8,Don't Buy Food Storage Containers Until You Watch This (7 Brands Tested),"Which food storage containers are the best? To find out, I put seven popular sets to the test, including Rubbermaid EasyFindLids, Amazon Basics, Rubbermaid Brilliance, Pyrex Snapware Total Solution, OXO Good Grips Smart Seal, Pyrex Ultimate, and Caraway. I tested each container for leaks by shaking it upside down with water inside, and for airtightness by submerging it in water and checking for bubbles. I microwaved tomato sauce to see if it stained, stored garlic to test for lingering odors, froze them overnight to check for warping or cracking, and baked them in the oven if they were labeled oven-safe. I also opened and closed each one 300 times to see how the latches held up. You’ll see which containers passed, which failed, and what features matter the most when picking out food storage containers.

It should provide clear, detailed information about the product or service in question, as well as highlighting any potential shortcomings or flaws. The review should include information on the product’s features and benefits, as well as how it fares against similar products from competitors. The review should also include customer experiences and opinions, so it’s helpful to include a variety of customer experiences to provide a balanced and comprehensive picture.

This is the NARWAL Freo Z10 Ultra Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo, Dual RGB Cameras and Chips, AI Avoidance, 8N Corner to Edge Deep Cleaning, Dry-Wet Separation, 18000Pa, Hot Water Wash & Self-Emptying, Gray
It has great features:
Advanced AI Obstacle Avoidance: The Narwal robot vacuum uses dual RGB cameras with AI chips to identify 200+ household objects. It avoids pet accidents with a 150mm buffer, navigates within 8mm of furniture, and reacts instantly to hazards for reliable, precise cleaning.
Edge-to-Corner Mop Coverage: This mop robot extends and swings its mop to clean edges, corners, and under toe-kicks. With 8N downward pressure, it scrubs away tough messes in hard-to-reach areas, ensuring complete coverage.
Quiet Self-Emptying Base with Hot-Water Wash: The self-emptying dock quietly maintains the mop with 104–140°F hot-water washing, finishes with a 167°F rinse, and dries automatically to prevent odors. A 2.5L dust bag stores up to 120 days of debris, making this self emptying robot vacuum cleaner easy to maintain.
18,000Pa Suction with Tangle-Free Brush: Delivering 18,000Pa suction, the Narwal vacuum robot captures dust, crumbs, and pet hair with ease. A certified tangle-free brush plus EdgeSwing technology ensures deep cleaning along walls and edges without hair wrap.
DualFlow Anti-Tangle System: The vacuum mop robot’s DualFlow system prevents brush clogs. Side brushes sweep hair into the roller, and a strong suction burst transfers it directly into the dustbin — reducing tangles and minimizing post-cleaning work.
Real-Time Adaptive Cleaning: Dual AI chips let this robotic vacuum cleaner analyze dirt instantly and switch between vacuuming and mopping. Cross-pattern cleaning handles spills, dust, and footprints for consistently clean floors.
Smart App & Pet Mode: Control the Narwal cleaning robot via app or voice assistant for flexible cleaning. Pet Mode detects pets in real time, avoids disturbing them, and supports live video check-ins — ideal for families with pets.
Note: Only supports 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. 5GHz Wi-Fi is not supported. 100-240V",Rebecca Brand,2025-11-20T18:14:23Z,19156,767,26,product reviews

BYwPv1o3NYM,Wonders of Italy | Most Beautiful Places - Travel Video,"Across a relatively small stretch of southern Europe lies a country where some of the world’s most recognizable destinations sit only a few hours apart. What makes them remarkable is not just their beauty, but the very different stories behind them. A single trip can move from ancient streets that have been walked for two thousand years, to coastal roads carved into cliffs, to islands that once hosted emperors and traders from far beyond the Mediterranean.",touropia,2025-11-22T11:37:25Z,6055,166,8,travel vlog

qsNwYzAylcU,Entering Taliban Controlled Afghanistan in 2025,"https://try.airalo.com/mikeokay - Download Airalo Here and Get $3 off Your First ESIM!

This video marks the first in a 3 vid special. When I entered Afghanistan through Ubzekistan this month, I found a really interesting road on a map. So I decided to travel it. Of course it wasn't that simple! 

Once upon a time, Afghanistan was the ultimate stop on the 1970s Hippie Trail. a place of freedom, music, and discovery. Fifty years later, I return to a country scarred by war and isolation, to see what’s left.

enjoy, mike x

Where you can kick off your shoes, leave work behind, and cocktails are provided at the snap of a finger. But island escapes aren’t just about lazy beach days. They can also be full of adventure, water sports, wildlife-watching, and age-old cultures you can trace back over thousands of years. So, whether you’re looking for that typical tropical beach escape or a trip to an exotic ecosystem untouched by tourism, there’s an island out there calling your name.

In today’s vlog, something truly unexpected happened in Trinidad! I met a Malayali priest who is also a passionate farmer—living a peaceful, grounded life thousands of kilometres away from Kerala. He welcomed me to his farm, shared his journey, and gave me a beautiful glimpse of how Malayali culture thrives even abroad.

After that heartwarming encounter, I headed to the world-famous Pitch Lake, the largest natural asphalt deposit on Earth. Walking on this bubbling, ever-moving landscape felt like stepping onto another planet!

Join me as I explore unique cultures, surprising connections, and incredible natural wonders in Trinidad. 🌍❤️

QZx2tjZI2OQ,TORONTO CHANGED HOW I SEE CANADA!,"📍Toronto, Canada. Get the best web host for your Wordpress business website or blog ➡️ https://wpx.net/?affid=5285 (Use code: DOTSONAMAP for 50% off your first month

Toronto is one of the fastest-growing cities in North America, and the biggest city in Canada. It has a booming population and an ever-growing skyline, with 70 skyscrapers springing up within the last decade and even more still being built. It's also the most diverse city in the entire world, with just about 50% of the population born outside Canada. All this makes Toronto an incredibly interesting place to visit and eat. And it might just turn your preconceived notions about Canada — and what it means to be Canadian — upside down.

Our Ultimate Travel Guide to Bangkok, Thailand! We're back in Bangkok this summer to explore all the best things to see and places to visit in the Thai capital.

Planning a trip to Bangkok? Check out our 3 Day Bangkok Travel Itinerary:

Day 1: After an Eastern Thai dinner and checking into our hotel, we spend our first morning exploring the best cafes in Bangkok's Ekkamai district. Then we revisit our favorite Thai food spots in Bangkok, starting at one of the best restaurants in Central Embassy. The rest of the afternoon is for shopping and Thai massages before dinner at a Michelin Guide favorite, Polo Fried Chicken.

Day 2:
More Cafe hopping before spending the day at one Bangkok's most popular shopping malls, Icon Siam. Its Souk Food Court is a must-visit for Thai street food. Lunch is at a legendary Pad Thai restuarant and dinner is at a Michelin Northern Thai restaurant.

Day 3:
After having the best brunch in Bangkok and checking out a must-try Thai cafe, we explore more of Bangkok's best luxury malls, have dinner at a Michelin Chicken Rice shop, and even pass by a festival honoring the country's unique Thai fruits.

Join us next week for more of our Thailand Travels!

Learn English naturally with this travel vlog as I explore London and my hometown in York — teaching real-life English through conversations, street scenes, and family moments (using comprehensible input).

In this video, we…
 1. Learn 30+ everyday English words and expressions from real life in London — including transport, sightseeing, and family talk.
 2. Explore famous streets and quiet corners, learning natural ways to describe what you see, do, and feel in British English.
 3. Spend time with my uncle and chat casually, helping you understand real conversation rhythms and common vocabulary.

Bonus: Watch cinematic scenes of London life and get English explanations that make it easier to remember and speak fluently.

PnfdGFtZOPI,"48 Hrs in Colombo, Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 | Best Places to Visit, Local Food, Casino & Nightlife | Travel Vlog","Welcome to Colombo, the lively capital of Sri Lanka — where culture, chaos, calmness, and coastal beauty come together in the most unexpected way. 

In this vlog, I spent one full day exploring the top things to do in Colombo, from serene temples and colorful markets to local food, history, and the city’s vibrant nightlife. Whether you’re planning a short stopover or a weekend getaway, this is your complete Colombo travel guide!

🪔 1️⃣ Gangaramaya Temple

One of the most famous and beautiful temples in Colombo, Gangaramaya Temple blends modern architecture with cultural heritage. From golden Buddha statues to sacred relics and vintage cars in its museum — every corner tells a story. It’s peaceful, spiritual, and a must-visit for first-time travelers to Sri Lanka.

🌊 2️⃣ Seema Malakaya Temple

Just a short walk from Gangaramaya, Seema Malakaya is a floating temple built on Beira Lake. Surrounded by calm waters and city skyline views, it’s the perfect spot for quiet reflection or stunning photos. Designed by Geoffrey Bawa, this place shows how beautifully spirituality and design can meet.

🛍️ 3️⃣ Pettah Market

If you want to feel the real pulse of Colombo — head to Pettah Market. It’s loud, colorful, and full of energy! From spices and fabrics to souvenirs and street snacks, this market is a treat for the senses. Bargaining is a must, and getting lost here is half the fun!

🇱🇰 4️⃣ Independence Memorial Hall

A symbol of Sri Lanka’s freedom, the Independence Memorial Hall is both grand and peaceful. The stone lions, colonial architecture, and the open park surrounding it make it a beautiful place to take a stroll and soak in the country’s history.

🍛 5️⃣ Sri Lankan Food Experience

No trip to Colombo is complete without tasting local Sri Lankan food! From Kottu Roti — a loud, sizzling street dish made with roti, eggs, and spices — to hoppers, sambols, and milk tea, every bite is full of flavor. I tried my first Kottu Roti here and it was absolutely addictive!

🌅 6️⃣ Galle Face Green & Marine Drive

As the sun sets, head to Galle Face Green, a long stretch by the ocean where locals gather to eat, relax, and watch the waves. You can grab some street food, fly a kite, or just walk by the sea. Later, take a coastal drive along Marine Drive — the views of the ocean and skyline at night are magical.

🎰 7️⃣ Bellagio Casino Colombo

To end the night, I visited Bellagio Casino — one of the most happening nightlife spots in Colombo! No entry fee, free 5-star level food and drinks, and a lively vibe — this place feels like mini-Vegas on a budget. You can even try your luck starting with as little as ₹200. Whether you play or not, it’s an experience worth having in Sri Lanka!

💡 Travel Tips for Indians Visiting Sri Lanka:

🇮🇳 Visa-free entry (just apply for ETA online at least 3–4 days before your trip)

💸 1 INR ≈ 3.4 LKR — exchange at local money changers for better rates

📱 Buy a Dialog SIM at the airport (500 INR for 1-week plan — great network!)

🚗 Use the PickMe app for cabs and tuk-tuks

🏨 Mid-range hotels cost around ₹1500–₹2500 per night

🧭 If you’re planning your Sri Lanka itinerary, this vlog will help you plan:

✅ Best places to visit in Sri Lanka
✅ Colombo nightlife & food guide

Zvr8FLWc1H0,"Al Ula – Betul ke ni Kota yang di LAKNAT?! (Hegra, Madain Saleh)","Kita selalu dengar tentang AlUla, kota kaum Thamud (Madain Saleh) yang dikatakan tempat dilaknat Allah. Tapi betul ke sebenarnya kawasan ni bumi Kaum Nabi Saleh (Madain Saleh) Yang di Laknat dan disebut dalam Al-Quran?

Ramai yang cepat menghukum, judge tanpa tahu kisah sebenar di sebalik AlUla dan Hegra, tapak warisan dunia UNESCO di Saudi Arabia.

Dalam video ni, aku bersama MKM Ticketing Travel datang sendiri ke AlUla,
untuk tengok dengan mata kepala sendiri, apa sebenarnya kisah di sebalik “kota yang dilaknat” ni.

Adakah ia benar-benar tempat kaum Thamud?

🎥 Saksikan perjalanan penuh keindahan dan pengajaran di AlUla & Hegra (Madain Saleh) tempat yang buat kita fikir semula tentang kuasa Allah, sejarah, dan pengajaran untuk manusia hari ini.

vZdYo_1Pwz8,my solo trip to the swiss alps,"WATCH THIS VERSION INSTEAD IT'S MUCH BETTER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5daW6S3sPc&t=621s

i know some (most) of the song choices are a bit random, there were copyright claims to the original music (and i hastily edited with subpar music which apparently is IRREVERSABLE) :(


EDIT: wow- thank you guys for all the love on this video!! i've seen so many comments saying that this video has inspired them to visit appenzell, and i'm so excited for you all to explore this amazing place - it's truly an unforgettable experience

but please, if you do visit, LEAVE NO TRACE. increased foot traffic often leads to more litter, damaged trails, and harm to wildlife. so please, let's work together to protect these beautiful places - respect nature, stay on marked trails, pack out everything you bring in, and leave it better than you found it. that way, others can enjoy it just as much as you (and i) did :)


hiking routes:
day 1- https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/switzerland/outer-rhodes/ebenalp-schafler-seealpsee-wasserauen?u=i
*note: if you have sore/weak knees and want to do the day one hike- I would recommend doing it in reverse (starting at the lake and hiking up)- it's a steep decent that is not for the weak knees (literally)
day 2- https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/switzerland/appenzell-inner-rhodes/schwende-seealpsee?u=i

vnwxROxXFwI,Our First Time in PAKISTAN 🇵🇰 Culture SHOCK in KARACHI (emotional),"We finally made it to Karachi, Pakistan — and our arrival was nothing short of wild. From a chaotic first drive that ended in a car crash (we’re okay!) to finding comfort in a cozy local hotel, this day had it all.

After catching our breath, we hit the streets to meet some amazing locals and experience Karachi’s legendary hospitality firsthand. Our evening ended at the iconic Kolachi restaurant by the sea — where we tried incredible traditional Pakistani food with a view to remember.

This city is raw, real, and full of energy — and we can’t wait to explore more.

🌍 Watch our full Karachi adventure — the highs, the chaos, and the warmth that makes Pakistan unforgettable.

-xQrA0RaAvA,"48 hours in Sapa, Vietnam. ⛰️","xin chao!!! 🇻🇳

went to Sapa last May — this trip felt like such a breather. honestly, I’d been feeling like a hamster on a treadmill for months, so this was exactly what I needed. 🫠 

every day on this trip felt surreal. no wonder they call it the Switzerland of Vietnam!! but on some days, it lowkey reminded me of Baguio too. we share so many similarities with the Vietnamese — especially the woven fabrics they were selling in Cat Cat Village. even the lolas! 😄 

also… the red train!!! I don’t know why but as a Harry Potter fan, I romanticized the heck out of it. every time it passed by, it felt like a movie scene. (WHAT IS LIFE W/O ROMANTICIZING IT? IT'S URS ANYWAY!!!)

~ yada yada. hope you enjoy this one — a travel diary of some sort :)

vZdYo_1Pwz8,my solo trip to the swiss alps,"WATCH THIS VERSION INSTEAD IT'S MUCH BETTER: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5daW6S3sPc&t=621s

i know some (most) of the song choices are a bit random, there were copyright claims to the original music (and i hastily edited with subpar music which apparently is IRREVERSABLE) :(


EDIT: wow- thank you guys for all the love on this video!! i've seen so many comments saying that this video has inspired them to visit appenzell, and i'm so excited for you all to explore this amazing place - it's truly an unforgettable experience

but please, if you do visit, LEAVE NO TRACE. increased foot traffic often leads to more litter, damaged trails, and harm to wildlife. so please, let's work together to protect these beautiful places - respect nature, stay on marked trails, pack out everything you bring in, and leave it better than you found it. that way, others can enjoy it just as much as you (and i) did :)

Zvr8FLWc1H0,"Al Ula – Betul ke ni Kota yang di LAKNAT?! (Hegra, Madain Saleh)","Kita selalu dengar tentang AlUla, kota kaum Thamud (Madain Saleh) yang dikatakan tempat dilaknat Allah. Tapi betul ke sebenarnya kawasan ni bumi Kaum Nabi Saleh (Madain Saleh) Yang di Laknat dan disebut dalam Al-Quran?

Ramai yang cepat menghukum, judge tanpa tahu kisah sebenar di sebalik AlUla dan Hegra, tapak warisan dunia UNESCO di Saudi Arabia.

Dalam video ni, aku bersama MKM Ticketing Travel datang sendiri ke AlUla,
untuk tengok dengan mata kepala sendiri, apa sebenarnya kisah di sebalik “kota yang dilaknat” ni.

Adakah ia benar-benar tempat kaum Thamud?

🎥 Saksikan perjalanan penuh keindahan dan pengajaran di AlUla & Hegra (Madain Saleh) tempat yang buat kita fikir semula tentang kuasa Allah, sejarah, dan pengajaran untuk manusia hari ini.

[New Zealand Travel Vlog 🏔️🦌 | Queenstown → Lake Tekapo → Mount Cook | the most beautiful & serene dream 🌾 ]

Hi friends, 

We’ve just returned from one of the most beautiful trips we've ever taken—actually, the most beautiful! 🌳✨
It was also my first time filming with my new travel camera, so please bear with me if some of the footage isn’t perfect. I ended up using my iPhone for much of the filming, especially at the start when I was still figuring out how to use the camera... 🫣
Still, I’m beyond excited to share this serene dream with all of you 💭

I hope you will enjoy these little fragments of my life~

3kOOAg-PsJs,Ireland’s Most Beautiful Drive: Sky Road & Connemara (Day2)! 🇮🇪,"Left Galway in the morning and drove into Connemara - quiet roads, open landscapes, lakes, and sheep everywhere. 
Stopped at Kylemore Abbey, then drove the Sky Road with stunning views of mountains, ocean, and fields. Continued to Clifden for a short break before heading to Sligo. 
Slow roads, peaceful towns, and beautiful landscapes all day. Ended with a late-night drive to Sligo, tired but happy.

LeHCjolJyZM,"Ang ganda dito kala mo nasa ibang bansa ka! George Point, Pantabangan, Nueva Ecija","Sa video na ito, pupuntahan natin ang George Point sa Pantabangan, Nueva Ecija, isang napakagandang pasyalan kung saan makikita ang mga gumagalaw na dinosaurs na parang totoo dahil sa husay ng pagkakagawa. Perfect spot para sa pamilya, barkada, at mga mahilig sa kakaibang adventure!

6E5kAAVx9bw,NAKAKAKILABOT! SOLO CAMPING: BALER (MAY MULTO?!!😱),"Sa video na ito, nag motor ako mag-isa mula Tarlac papuntang Baler, Aurora! 
Dinaanan natin ang CLLEX (Central Luzon Link Expressway), ang scenic view ng Pantabangan–Canili Bypass Road, at ang Maria Aurora to Baler Road na talaga namang napakaganda ng mga tanawin! 

Pagdating sa Diguisit, Baler, nag solo camping tayo sa isang napakagandang campsite — napapalibutan ng mga puno ng niyog, berdeng damo, at asul na dagat. 
Pinasyalan din natin ang mga white sand beach sa Diguisit at ang Baler Lighthouse.

Pero habang nag so-solo camp sa gabi… may kakaiba tayong naramdaman 😨
Nakakatindig-balahibo! Multo ba ‘yun o imahinasyon lang?
Panoorin hanggang dulo para malaman! 👻🔥

Location: Villa Gallegos Beach Resort, Diguisit, Baler, Auror

If you simply take the time to watch this through and apply all of these muscle gain tips to your hypertrophy workouts, it truly could make a very significant difference to your bottom line muscle growth and strength gains. There's so much misleading workout advice out there nowadays both in YouTube fitness and social media to where most bodybuilding beginners have been led completely off course. The training advice in this video will help bring you back to the basics so you can focus in on the things that truly matter for gaining muscle and eliminate the inessentials.",Sean Nalewanyj,2021-11-15T15:27:55Z,4095821,152016,3994,fitness tips

In a nutshell:

15 Fitness Tips That Changed My Life For The Better The best approach is to make simple changes to your daily habits over time.  With any diet, the most important thing to remember is to stay hydrated.  Drinking water will support your body with digestion, transporting nutrients to your bones and muscles, and even improving cognitive function.  Ideally, you want to drink about half your body weight in ounces per day, i. 

e.  if you weigh 150 pounds, you should drink 75 ounces of water a day.  2.  Add Some Lemon and Apple Cider Vinegar to Your Water Therefore, hydrating your body first thing in the morning is absolutely necessary. 

 The best way to achieve hydration is by starting your day with a glass or even two of water.  The lemon and apple cider vinegar will help your body detoxify, cleanse, and digest.  Yes, keeping hydrated is important, but try to avoid high-calorie drinks, such as soft drinks, specialty coffee, and juices as they are full of fast-acting sugar.  This will promote a healthy cooldown, improve flexibility, and reduce next-day aches. 

 Failure to stretch can lead to injuries and muscle damage.  You may have heard about HIIT training because it is the big thing right now, and believe us when we say that it works and should absolutely be included in your fitness goals.  The benefits include lower body fat, increased stamina, leaner muscles, and fantastic hormonal benefits.  Performing a HIIT routine 1-3 times a week will lead to great results. 

 Not only does it look good, but it also has great health benefits, including: Reduced body fat 5.  Protects and improves joint health 8.  Decrease Body Fat Reducing your body fat has a lot of benefits such as: 7.  Better hormonal profiles in your body Remember, it is not a race to see how quickly you can decrease your body fat. 

 Healthy weight loss is around 1-2 pounds a week for your fitness goals.  It is important to ensure you are getting as many nutrients and vitamins from the food you are eating as possible.  Focus on dark, leafy greens, as they will provide you with a wide array of vitamins, minerals, nutrients, and antioxidants—all of which your body needs! Another top goal you can start immediately is reducing the amount of sugar you consume.  There`s no surprise we eat too much sugar, and this should be one of your top fitness goals moving forward. 

 The workout is where you go to break down muscle tissue, and it builds back through proper nutrition, rest, and recovery.  It might be tempting to go to the gym for two hours every day as hard as you can to achieve your goals, but that`s not the most effective approach.  When you are deprived of sleep, you make it next to impossible to achieve your health and fitness goals.  Lack of sleep can increase stress hormones in your body, and over time these can lead to inflammation and chronic diseases. 

Also, allow yourself some wind-down time and a pre-bed routine to help get more consistent sleep every night.

I know you’re wondering why some of the exercises that are in weight loss videos are featured in a whole video about how to gain weight. Great question and I have a great answer :-) 

All of the exercises featured in this video are what are considered to be multi purpose exercises. Which means they are equally effective for weight gain and weight loss. 

Wait. what! how? :)
If a person’s goal is weight loss, and they are in eating fewer calories than they burn per day, the effect of these exercises will be more toning, more endurance, and more strength in the muscles targeted.

People eating in a calorie balance for weight maintenance will have a similar toning, strengthening and endurance effect.

If a person’s goal is weight gain and they are eating more calories than they burn per day, the effect of these exercises will be more toning, more endurance, more strength AND more size in the muscles. Aka muscle growth.

It is this growth of the muscle that is being referred to here as weight gain.

These exercises do not add fat to the body. I repeat, these exercises do not cause fat gain in the body 😄

Will these exercises make you bulky? If you’re exercising with body weight or simple dumbbells are home, no. You won’t become bulky.

If you’re going to the gym and lifting heavy weights like 90lb barbells or 50lb, you probably still won’t become bulky but at that stage, it really boils down to each person’s genetic predisposition.

More about the reason this weight gain video came to be :)
5 Best Exercises to Gain Weight Quickly
How to gain weight fast is one of the most asked questions I get these days. In order to gain weight, you have to take care of your diet and eat a higher calorie diet (relative to the calories you burn per day). You can then considerably influence the weight gain through exercise. This video tells how to gain weight for skinny girls. In this video I have shown 5 best exercises to gain weight quickly. The struggle of gaining weight can be quite long. However, if you do these 5 exercises, while eating a high(er) calorie diet then you can be sure of getting great results.
All these weight gain exercises are really easy to learn and you can do them at the gym as well as at home. These include pushups, squats, overhead presses, lunges, and dips. One thing to remember when doing different exercises for gaining weight, is that you have to focus on getting your form right instead of rushing through the movements. Always do these exercises slowly if you want to build muscle. Also, like all exercises, you should do these regularly in order to see great results. Gaining weight fast for women is entirely possible by regularly doing these exercises and eating a high(er) calorie diet. Through these exercises, you can easily build muscle at home or at the gym. Simply try these exercises for weight gain for a few weeks and see the amazing results in the form of curves in all the right places.

A2s4QLmND2E,The ONLY 2 Exercises for Chiseled Abs,"If you want to have chiseled abs that pop, then these are the only 2 exercises you need for that six pack. There are lots of ab exercises to pick from, but when you understand the key functions of the rectus abdominis muscle, then you know that you can narrow your choices down to the ones that are going to be most effective for getting a 6 pack.

Of course, your pursuit is always going to depend on having good nutrition. You simply cannot have a junk food diet and think that you are going to calorically remain in enough of a deficit to remain lean. 

That said, if you want to get chiseled abs that get attention when you lift your shirt then you want to choose from two distinct groups of ab exercises. The first is the exercises that move your chest towards the pelvis - or the top down movements. The second is the exercise group that moves your pelvis towards your chest  - the bottom up movements.

To make sure that each is maximally effective however, it helps to know your current ability level.

Knowing this allows me to give you a top down and bottom up recommendation that matches your capabilities and lets you scale to better and better ab exercises as you get stronger.

See the ab exercise choices here:

BOTTOM UP
beginners - reverse corkscrew (knees bent)
intermediate - reverse corkscrew (knees straight)
advanced - hanging corkscrew

TOP DOWN
beginners - upper circle crunch
intermediate - power over
advanced - cable crunch pulldown

Choose one from each group and perform 2-3 sets each day to failure. 

The more you do these the harder your abs will get as they get stronger and more developed. And again, when combined with a few sets of table pushaways to make sure that your diet stays in check and that you keep your body fat levels low, then the sky is the limit for how good your midsection can look in even a very short period of time from now.

But the key is, when you choose the right ab exercises you don't need a lot of them. In fact, only 2 ab exercise options are needed to start chiseling up that six pack.

Puts more focus on the glutes & hamstring. The legs are slightly bent and the hips are pushed back.

2️⃣ SLDL= Stiff Leg Deadlift
Just focus on the hamstring. The legs are almost completely straight
and the hips are NOT pushed back.

MeTo-pwrl-4,❗️ HANGING KNEE RAISE — KNOW THE DIFFERENCE! #animation #fitness #tips #workout #bodyweight #gym,"Want abs? Not all knee raises hit the ABS how you think — it’s all about TECHNIQUE!

1️⃣ Knee Raise (No Pelvic Tilt)

❓How-to:  
— Simply lift your knees up, don’t round your lower back or tilt pelvis.  
— Upper body stays still.

⚡️Activation:  
— Hip Flexors: 80% (main workhorses here)  
— Abs: Static hold only (no crunch action)

✔️ Good for: Hip flexor strength & keeping hips mobile, especially if you sit a lot!  
🚩 Most do it like this, BUT think they train abs… Waste for six-pack growth!

2️⃣ Knee Raise WITH Pelvic Tilt (Correct for Abs)

❓How-to:  
— Bring knees up AND tuck your pelvis (curl tailbone up!).  
— Feel abs contract, round lower back at top.

⚡️Activation:  
— Abs (Rectus): 90% — max tension & real six-pack work!  
— Hip Flexors: Still help, but abs do the main job.

🔑 Key:  
REAL lower ab work needs the pelvis to be tucked! Otherwise, it’s mostly hip flexors.

✅ No pelvic tilt: Hip flexors in tone (great if you’re stuck at a desk — but always STRETCH them after!)  
✅ With pelvic tilt: TRUE lower abs work!

👇 Been skipping the tilt? Share your style!

1️⃣Hand Placement: Grip the edge of the bench with your fingers curled around it, rather than placing your hands flat on top.
This improves stability and reduces wrist strain.

2️⃣Width of Hands: Keep your hands shoulder-width apart. Placing them too wide shifts tension from the triceps to other muscles, reducing effectiveness.

3️⃣Body Distance from Bench: Avoid drifting too far away from the bench, as it takes tension off the triceps, making the exercise less effective.

4️⃣Elbow Position: Keep your elbows tucked in throughout the movement. This keeps more tension on the triceps and helps prevent elbow injuries.

X_mhesFfpc8,Forearm Balance Fitness tips!,"Do you love😍 or hate😩 backbends? Or maybe just somewhere in the middle?😐

Today, I’m back with more Forearm Balance Fitness tips and surprise, we are back bending!🙌🏻

If you have tight shoulders, day 8 is going to be a challenge but just because it’s hard doesn’t mean it will always be hard. It takes courage to hop up to the wall and even more to drop down into a backbend. #yougotthis

#Backbends are generally a 😐 experience for me. If I’m honest, I don’t love doing them. 

When I practice them on a regular basis, my shoulder and #backflexibility greatly improve. I also find that my back is less cranky.

I don’t think I will ever love them. I don’t understand when people tell me they “love” to do backbends. What do you love??

I wish I felt that way. Backbends are something in my practice that I do because I know I should, and the benefits outweigh my 😐 feeling.

For day 8, try kicking up to the wall and dropping one leg to the floor. Continue to kick back over several times. After 5 reps, place both feet on the floor and hold for 5 full breaths.

All the drills I share are in my Inversions Make You Hot program! Learn all things upside down!

You can sign up using the link in my profile. All my programs are included with a BYG membership!

h-Y125W-oN8,Following A 1930s Magazine Makeup Tutorial 💄,"so i heard about this vintage makeup magazine from the 1930s, and knew we had to try it out!! the magazine is full of tips and tutorials on how to do your makeup in a way that best suits your face, hair color, & complexion (though for a pretty limited range of skin tones). according to the magazine, i’m a ✨ spanish brunette ✨, which apparently means i need lots of rouge and purple eyeshadow (even on my double chin)! let me know what you guys think - are there any other decade looks you guys would want to see?? 🤔 

also shout out to @erinparsonsmakeup for the video inspo!!

bhS7lD04p8A,“YOUR MAKEUP LOOKS BAD” READ BELOW! ❤️ #beautytips #makeuptutorial #acnepositivity,"Your reminder that the super glam makeup you see online is in front of professional lighting and taken at a direct angle that makes skin texture look more blurred and smooth! We don’t see this type of makeup as much in dynamic lighting or out and about. Makeup will look like makeup on the skin!!! Especially if you have skin texture like me and that is NORMAL! 

Yes there are techniques to make it look “smoother” but at the end of the day it is not a filter! ❤️

Tune into my podcast weekly where we break down the walls of beauty standards one flaw at a time 🥰

tAD9nUsURSk,10 Depression-Era Recipes That Still Taste Amazing Today | Allrecipes,"Looking for ways to save money in the kitchen without sacrificing flavor? In this video, Nicole makes 10 Great Depression–era recipes that prove resourceful cooking can still be delicious nearly a century later. From pantry staples to clever substitutions, she shares thrifty tips and techniques inspired by home cooks of the 1930s — all while whipping up comforting, old-fashioned meals that stand the test of time.

We start with Hoover Stew, a hearty mix of pasta, beans, and canned goods that fed families across America, followed by a nostalgic Poor Man’s Meal of potatoes, onions, and hot dogs. Nicole then makes a simple Egg Drop Soup, crispy Stuffed Potato Pancakes, and savory Eggs with Peppers and Potatoes that turn humble ingredients into something special. Next up are Cabbage and Noodles, creamy Chipped Beef on Toast, and homemade Depression Bread that’s easy, soft, and satisfying. Finally, she brings a touch of sweetness with Water Pie and Wacky Cake — two desserts that stretch ingredients while still feeling indulgent.

Whether you’re cooking on a budget, love vintage recipes, or just want a cozy kitchen project, these Depression-era dishes show how simple cooking can be comforting, clever, and timeless.

Want to START a business? Go here: https://skool.com/games 

If you’re new to my channel, my name is Alex Hormozi. I’m the founder and managing partner of Acquisition.com. It’s a family office, which is just a formal way of saying we invest our own money into companies. Our 10 portfolio companies bring in over $200,000,000+ per year. Our ownership stake varies between 20% and 100% of them. Given this is a YT channel, and anyone can claim anything, I’ll give you some stuff you can google to verify below.

How I got here…

21: Graduated Vanderbilt in 3 years Magna Cum Laude, and took a fancy consulting job.
23 yrs old: Left my fancy consulting job to start a business (a gym).
24 yrs old: Opened 5 gym locations.
26 yrs old: Closed down 6th gym. Lost everything. 
26 yrs old: Got back to launching gyms (launched 33). Then, lost everything for a 2nd time. 
26 yrs old: In desperation, started licensing model as a hail mary. It worked. 
27 yrs old: ""Gym Launch"" does $3M profit the next 6 months. Then $17M profit next 12 months.
28 yrs old: Started Prestige Labs. $20M the first year.  
29 yrs old: Launched ALAN, a software company for agencies to work leads for customers. Scaled to $1.7mmo within 6 months. 
31 yrs old: Sold 75% of UseAlan to a strategic buyer in an all stock deal. 
31 yrs old: Sold 66% of Gym Launch & Prestige Labs at $46.2M valuation in all-cash deal to American Pacific Group. (you can google it)
31 yrs old: Started our family office Acquisition.com. We invest and scale companies using the $42M in distributions we had taken + the cash from the $46.2M exit.
32 yrs old: Started making free content showing how we grow companies to make real business education accessible to everyone (and) to attract business owners to invest or scale their businesses. 
34 yrs old: I became co-owner of https://Skool.com to help the many people who want to start a business online do so.

Today: Our portfolio now does $200M/yr between 10 companies. The largest doing $100M/yr the smallest doing $5M per year. Our ownership varies between 20% and 100% ownership of the companies. Many of them we invested in early and helped grow (which is how we make our money - not youtube videos).

To all the gladiators in the arena, we’re all in the middle of writing our own stories. The worse the monsters, the more epic the story.

You either get an epic outcome or an epic story. Both mean you win. 

Keep crushing. May your desires be greater than your obstacles. 

Never quit,

Alex

00:53 – Startup Idea
05:55 – Trend
08:17 – News Item
12:05 – Product Framework
15:31 – AI Tool
17:00 – Product Recommendation

*Startup Idea*
Solo Female Travel Safety Platform
The problem: 84% of solo female travelers feel unsafe. No reliable platform answers basic safety questions.
The solution: Map-based reviews where verified female travelers rate neighborhoods, hotels, and restaurants on actual safety metrics.
Path to $500K ARR:

* 5,000 members at $30/month
* Hotel safety certifications at $500/month
* Lead magnet: Free travel safety quiz
* Distribution: Facebook groups (400K members), travel influencers, short-form video

*Trend:*
Gamification UI: Duolingo did it. Social platforms are built on it. More apps and websites are adding points, badges, leaderboards, and challenges.
The opportunity: Launch an agency specializing exclusively in gamification. Start at $10K/month.

*News Item*
Ex-Reddit CEO: ""AI Startups Have 12-18 Months""
Yishan's viral take (20M views): AI apps are flash-in-the-pan cash grabs. Foundational models will crush them.
Greg's counter: Great AI wrappers that own workflows, customers, and network effects will build billion-dollar companies. Remember when everyone said Apple would clone every successful app? That didn't happen.

*Product Framework:*
3-Step Creator Growth Playbook for SaaS

* Attach the right creator (target 120K followers or less for higher response rates)
* Offer generous affiliates (30-50% lifetime, not 10-20%)
* Gamify the experience (contests, trips, prizes for top performers)

Real example: Goji (apple cider vinegar gummy) hit hundreds of millions using gamified TikTok Shop affiliates.

*AI Tools:*
Krea AI: Alternative to Glyph AI. Generate images, video, 3D objects. Features Nodes product for building creative workflows.
Mini apps: Virtual try-on, hairstyle generator, object remover, product photo editor.

*Product Recommendations:*
La Colombe Cold Brew (Light Roast) - $5-8.49 at Target for multiple servings. Light, smooth, always cold when you need it.
Olipop Classic Root Beer - 35 cal, 3g sugar. Better than Diet Coke. 8.5/10.

Ever wonder what top VCs and successful founders are betting on for the next big thing? We’ve got the inside scoop! In this episode of ""Backstage With Millionaires,"" we're diving into a goldmine of opportunities: Antler India's exclusive report featuring 100 groundbreaking startup ideas for 2025, handpicked by the best minds in India's startup ecosystem.

With AI tools making it easier than ever to build, the real challenge is spotting the market's burning needs. This report cuts through the noise, giving you direct insights into what investors consider ""great ideas"" that can scale massively in the next 5-10 years.

We've distilled these 100 ideas into 7 crucial themes: AI, Fintech, Deeptech, Consumer, Climate, Health, and SaaS. For each theme, I'm picking one standout idea to deep-dive into, explaining the problem, the potential, and why it's poised for success.

Here’s a sneak peek at what we cover:

1. AI for India's SMEs (Aakrit Vaish - Haptik)
Discover how AI can revolutionize India's Small and Medium Enterprises, the backbone of our economy. From smart bookkeeping and inventory management to voice-first interfaces in local languages, learn how to build advanced AI tools that empower businesses struggling against modern competition. This is about more than just record-keeping; it’s about providing actionable insights and seamless integration with daily apps like WhatsApp and UPI.

2. Biometric Payments (Paroma Chatterjee - Revolut India)
Imagine a future where your face, fingerprint, or voice is your payment key. We explore how India, with its advanced UPI infrastructure, is ripe for biometric authentication layers. This isn't just about seamless transactions; it’s about next-level security that's hard to breach.

3. India's Robotics Opportunity (Soumitra Sharma - Operators Studio)
Tap into India’s massive STEM talent pool, manufacturing prowess, and global expertise to build robotics solutions for the world. Beyond factories, imagine robots assisting in education or playing sports. With government incentives and a global search for alternatives to Chinese manufacturing, the time for Indian robotics is now!

4. GenAI and the Future of Learning (Nitin Sharma - Antler)
Despite past challenges in EdTech, Generative AI is creating a new era of learning. We discuss how GenAI can power AI-tutors that guarantee learning outcomes, offer hyper-personalized content, and break language barriers, transforming education from sales-heavy to outcome-based models.

5. Fixing Pollution: A Billion-Dollar Opportunity (Nikhil Basu Trivedi - Footwork)
Air pollution is a critical problem in India, but it's also a multi-billion-dollar entrepreneurial opportunity. Learn how innovation, tailored for the Indian context, genuine technological breakthroughs, and patient capital can lead to scalable solutions for cleaner air.

6. Health Solutions for India’s ""Wealthy 50s"" (Nidhi Mathur - Axilor Ventures)
India’s demographic is shifting, creating a massive market of affluent individuals in their 50s and 60s who are keen on healthy aging, longevity, and wellness. Discover opportunities in luxury retreats, science-backed nutrition, and personalized fitness.

7. Scaling Global Services with Indian Talent (Gautam Mago - A91)
Explore the evolution of BPO to BPO 3.0 and 4.0, where AI combines with human expertise to deliver high-end, complex services globally. India’s vast pool of college graduates and decades of back-office experience position us perfectly to capture the next wave of global service demand.

8vXoI7lUroQ,How I use Reddit and AI to find winning startup ideas,"You can sign up to gummysearch.com/community or find startup ideas at ideabrowser.com In this episode, we dive deep into the process of finding validated startup ideas from Reddit using AI tools. I share my 4-step process and demonstrate how to use www.gummysearch.com/community to discover trending subreddits, identify problems and solutions, find creators in the niche, and create content that resonates with the audience.

1) Use Gummy Search to find trending subreddits

• Focus on 10k-100k member communities
• These answer the ""why now"" question
• Look for niches where you have an unfair advantage
• Pro tip: Check daily/weekly/monthly growth trends

2) Analyze subreddit for problems & solutions

• Add chosen subreddit to a Gummy Search ""audience""
• Examine ""pain and anger"" section for common patterns
• Check ""advice requests"" for what people are asking
• Review ""solution requests"" for competitive landscape
 • Key: Look for recurring themes and write them down!

3) Identify creators in the niche

• Use Perplexity.ai to find top influencers
• Search YouTube for their most popular videos
• Read comments to understand audience needs
• Do this for 20-25 videos to get deep insights
• This helps you think like your target audience

4) Wireframe your solution

• Based on insights, sketch out your product/service
• Use tools like Framer to quickly prototype
• Come up with a catchy, relevant name
• Example: DesignScientist.com for conversion-focused design

5) Bonus: Creating content that resonates

• Use Gummy Search's ""top content"" feature
• Analyze what performs well in the community
• Ask AI about content preferences (e.g., ""Do they love memes?"")
• Remember: Treat AI tools as your ""entrepreneurial assistant""

ndqX4vbR7Rc,Making $$$ with MicroSaaS (I might delete this),"On today’s episode I share a comprehensive guide to building microSaaS businesses, which are niche-focused software products that can be developed by individuals or small teams. I explain the difference between traditional SaaS and micro SaaS, share real examples of successful businesses generating $20K-40K monthly revenue, and outline a step-by-step playbook for validating ideas, building MVPs, and growing through audience building and SEO.

Timestamps:

01:08 - What is a MicroSaaS?
02:25 - Examples of successful micro SaaS businesses

07:57 - User journey and funnel metrics

32:30 - MicroSaaS Ideas 4: CartSaver
33:58 - MicroSaaS Ideas 5: GrantGuru

Get Your Complete Financial OS at https://www.brex.com/sip  

Key Points:
• Micro SaaS businesses focus on niche markets with specific products, typically built by solo founders or small teams
• Successful micro SaaS businesses can generate $10K-50K monthly profit with 80-90% margins
• Growth comes from building an audience first, identifying pain points, creating solutions, and reinvesting revenue
• Pricing strategies typically include free trials converting to monthly subscriptions or usage-based models

1) What is Micro SaaS?

Unlike big SaaS companies targeting everyone (think Salesforce), micro SaaS:

• Targets an extremely niche audience
• Offers a ""feature of a feature"" product
• Focuses on profitability (not growth at all costs)
• Can be built by a solo founder or tiny team
• Often reaches $10-50K monthly profit

Why build one? 80-90% margins and lifestyle freedom! 

2) Real Examples That WORK

• Bank Statement Converter: $40K/month, solo founder
Simply converts PDF bank statements to Excel format

• Projection: $24K/month
Projects your financial net worth visually

• CleanVoice: $20K/month
Edits podcasts by removing background noise, filler words, etc.

The pattern? Simple solution to SPECIFIC pain points!

3) The Growth Flywheel

Here's the secret sauce to micro SaaS success:

1. Build an audience/community FIRST
2. Learn their acute pain points
3. Build a solution to those pains
4. Generate word of mouth
5. Create recurring revenue
6. Reinvest in growing your audience

This is why building in public WORKS. The community becomes your distribution!

4) User Journey Breakdown

The typical micro SaaS journey:

• People have a manual, painful workflow
• They search Google/ChatGPT for a solution
• They find your micro SaaS (good domain name is KEY)
• They have a ""wow moment"" using your product
• Free trial converts to paying customer
• They tell friends or share in communities
• Growth compounds through referrals + SEO

5) The Numbers Game

Here's what success might look like:

• 10,000 monthly site visitors
• 1,500 free trials
• 300 active users
• 150 paying subscribers ($19/month)
• 30 true advocates who spread the word

Month 1: $200 revenue
Month 3: $2,000
Month 6-7: $7,000+

It COMPOUNDS if you reinvest in growth!

6) The Weekend MVP Approach

Don't spend months building! Instead:

• Time-constrain your MVP to 48 hours
• Use no-code tools or hire a freelancer
• Automate as much as possible
• Tweet your progress DAILY
• Create feedback loops
• Focus on distribution from day one

7) Finding the Perfect Opportunity

Use these frameworks to identify winning ideas:

• Market Gap Heat Map: Focus on high demand + few tools
• Problem-Pay Matrix: Target high pain + high willingness to pay
• Innovation Matrix: Aim for niche + high polish

The sweet spot? Where your passion meets monetization potential!

8) Micro SaaS Ideas You Can STEAL

5) ideas anyone can build:

• Permitting: Help homeowners navigate city permit processes ($99 one-time fee)
• Podscripter: Auto-generate show notes and video clips from podcast episodes ($29/month)
• SpecSheet: Convert PDF spec sheets into sortable comparison tables ($49/month)
• CartSaver: AI video messages to recover abandoned Shopify carts (1% of recovered revenue)
• GrantGuru: AI-powered grant proposal generator for nonprofits ($149/proposal)

2. Food related Facebook groups.
3. Small hoarding near local shops.
4. Pamphlets / hoarding near apartment complex for easy vast reach.
5. Advertise outside schools for parents to see a homemade option of cheese.

✅  PACKAGING -

The packaging depends on the variant of the cheese as mentioned in the video. Start with simple packaging only.

moLuSZMM-Qs,3 Creative Business Ideas #entrepreneurship #businessideas #shorts,"These are some of the most popular Indian brands that actually started as copies of foreign brands — but ended up becoming bigger and more successful than the originals! Sounds crazy, right?
In this video, we’ll explore the incredible business stories of how Minimalist, Oreo, Bingo Mad Angles, and Blah Blii Blue turned imitation into innovation — and built multi-crore Indian companies by understanding local markets, marketing psychology, and smart product adaptation.🇮🇳 Minimalist took heavy inspiration from The Ordinary — same white packaging, minimal design, and skincare concept. But by making it affordable and relatable for Indian consumers, it became a 3000 crore brand — a perfect example of brand localization done right. Oreo may be world-famous today, but did you know it was inspired by Hydrox Cookies? Through powerful branding and emotional marketing, Oreo turned the tables and became a global snack icon — proving that marketing beats originality when done smartly.Bingo Mad Angles clearly drew inspiration from Doritos, but they gave it an Indian twist with spicy masala flavors — and guess what? They started outselling Doritos in India. That’s called understanding your audience and customizing your product for the market.And then comes Blah Blii Blue — the wildest copy story ever. They replicated everything — the bottle, the site, the packaging — but still made 15 crores in 60 days. That’s speed, branding, and execution at its best.
This video reveals how copying smartly and adapting intelligently can transform a business from imitation to innovation — and how Indian entrepreneurs are rewriting the rules of global branding.
Watch till the end to discover how these brands proved that being a “copy” doesn’t mean being second-best — it can mean being smarter, faster, and more successful.Don’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more crazy business facts, startup stories, and marketing case studies every week!

lN_1nPUAZXE,The Dumbest Startup Ideas Ever,"In this video, you’ll learn how a $700 Wi-Fi juicer raised over $120 million in funding, got backed by Silicon Valley investors, and was marketed as the “iPhone of juicers.”
Sounds genius — until someone tried squeezing the juice bag by hand… and it worked. Faster. Cheaper. No tech required.

You’ll also hear how celebs hyped it, how one viral tweet exposed the scam, and why Juicero became one of the dumbest tech fails in startup history.

And of course — expect some sarcastic storytelling and a warning about vitamin C overdoses you didn’t ask for.",RAX THE DINOSAUR,2025-07-13T22:00:50Z,1764,10,0,startup ideas

F7MxPxNbFUw,How I Use AI & Reddit to Find $1M+ Startup Ideas (FULL Blueprint),"I share 17 practical methods for generating viable startup ideas in the AI era. The strategies focus on identifying pain points, tedious workflows, and manual processes that could be automated or improved with AI. These techniques can help both aspiring entrepreneurs seeking new ventures and established startup founders looking to expand their product offerings.

Timestamps:

00:00 - Intro
01:48 - Method 1: Using ChatGPT to identify tedious workflows
06:08 - Method 2: Analyzing your ChatGPT history
09:11 - Method 3: Searching Reddit for tool requests
12:00 - Methods 4-7: Finding friction points and using Idea Browser
15:08 - Methods 8-11: Exploring niche groups and software review sites
19:13 - Methods 12-15: Learning from agency owners and job titles
24:06 - Methods 16-17: Finding opportunities in low-rated but high-usage plugins

Key Points:

• Use ChatGPT to identify tedious workflows in specific professions that AI could automate
• Analyze your own ChatGPT history to find repeated prompts that could become products
• Search online platforms (Reddit, Facebook, Discord) for people asking about tools that don't exist
• Examine where you copy/paste between tools as these friction points represent startup opportunities
• Browse service marketplaces like Upwork and Fiverr to find manual tasks ripe for AI automation

1) Use ChatGPT to find tedious workflows

The prompt that WORKS:
""Give me 10 tedious workflows that a [JOB TITLE] does that AI could automate""

Pain = opportunity = CASH

Pro tip: Ask ChatGPT which workflow is MOST painful and why, then build your MVP around solving it!

2) Scroll your own ChatGPT history

If you're repeating the same prompt weekly, that's a product hiding in plain sight!

Example: If you constantly ask AI to ""make my writing clearer"" - there's your SaaS idea.

The unbundling of ChatGPT into vertical-specific tools is happening NOW.

3) Google search hack that finds GOLD

Type: site:reddit.com ""is there a tool"" [YOUR NICHE]

This reveals people LITERALLY begging for tools that don't exist yet.

These are potential customers telling you exactly what they want to pay for. Pure market research for FREE.

4) Audit where you copy & paste between tools

That friction point? It's a startup waiting to happen.

If you're copying emails into a CRM manually, others are too.

The most painful workflows are often the most profitable to solve!

5) Browse Upwork & Fiverr for repeated AI tasks

Look for gigs where people are:
• Paying good money
• For manual work
• That could be automated

If multiple clients want it done manually, it's RIPE for disruption with an AI-powered product.

6) Join Discord/Slack groups and search for ""does anyone have a tool for...""

These communities are GOLDMINES of unmet needs.

Set up automations to alert you when these phrases appear, then swoop in with your solution!

7) Use https://www.ideabrowser.com

Greg built this FREE tool that finds startup ideas from:
• Facebook groups
• Subreddits
• Google trends

It gives you a new idea DAILY with feasibility analysis and even pricing strategy. Why aren't you using this yet?!

8) Niche Facebook groups = untapped opportunity

Look for workflow hacking in the comments.

When people are cobbling together manual solutions, that's your cue to build the tool they're creating by hand.

Don't sleep on FB - still a BILLION monthly users with problems to solve!

9) Talk to business owners about their Excel workflows

Seriously. Just ask:
""What Excel tasks do you hate doing?""
""Which spreadsheets eat up your time?""

Pay them $50-100 for their insights if needed.

Their pain points = your AI agent waiting to be built.

10) Find multi-step tutorials using 8+ tools

When someone needs EIGHT different tools to accomplish one task...

That's your cue to build the one-click version.

People will PAY for products that make complex workflows simple and FAST.

Notable Quotes:

""If you're coming up with a startup idea that helps solve someone's pain, you will be able to make money from it.""

""What I'm saying, the ideas I like to work on are the ideas that I have odds stacked in my favor.""

Razer WORSE than Apple w/ Right to Repair #tech #technology #shorts","This is the second time I've been stopped from repairing a 2022 Razer Blade 15 Advanced computer because of lack of replacement parts. Razer is worse than Apple when it comes to right to repair because they outright refuse to sell replacement parts for any of their technology . At least Apple will sell you overpriced replacement parts that cost more than your device is worth. My customer is stuck with a pc that has a broken 4K OLED Display that uses proprietary tech , so they will have to send it in to Razer and pay over $600 to get it fixed. This is why I say the computer repair industry is dying. It's not like I'm trying to fix a CPU or GPU in my computer repair shop, I'm just trying to replace a broken display.

PtyLfEo7yJs,Why I NEVER Recommend Gaming Laptops #tech #pc #technology #shorts,"“What gaming laptop should I buy” is a question I get asked dozens of times a day, and my answer is always the same: Framework 16 or a ThinkPad P series. Because as a technician, I have a moral obligation to recommend things based on repairability and reliability. Which are the 2 least prioritized things on a gaming laptop. Whereas an enthusiast recommends things based on how new and powerful the tech is when it’s brand new. And since it’s impossible to tell what problems a new device will have in a few years, I can only rate things by how my past my experiences have been with certain models and companies. For example, the Acer Nitro is low-cost and fragile, but decently powerful and easy to upgrade and maintain. Higher end Lenovo Legions are fairly reliable and built sturdier than some others. But none of these have replaceable keyboards, and finding genuine parts is hit or miss. Framework 16 is expensive, but it has a modular GPU, parts are readily available, and you’re supporting a company that prioritizes right to repair. The ThinkPad P series is built sturdy, has a replaceable keyboard, a “gaming” GPU, and parts are easy to purchase. But whatever you choose, just clean the thing regularly.",Salem Techsperts,2025-09-12T14:10:01Z,8293917,465622,4763,technology

Curtis is the third studio album by American rapper 50 Cent; it was released on September 11, 2007, by Shady Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The album features production from Dr. Dre, Eminem, and Timbaland, among others. Music writers have noted that 50 Cent divides between ""hard"" and ""soft"" songs on the album.

Curtis received generally mixed reviews from music critics upon release. The album debuted at number 2 on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 691,000 copies in its first week. After years of slumping sales, the album's competition with Kanye West's Graduation (2007) and the resulting record breaking performances both albums displayed was considered to be a ""great day for hip hop.""

3hSbLuLM-do,"Japan Just Unlocked GOD MODE Internet - 125,000,000 Mbps #shorts","Japan has recently set a new world record in internet speed by reaching an incredible 1.02 petabits per second. To put it simply, this speed is so fast that you could download over 125,000 gigabytes of data in just one second. It’s millions of times faster than the internet most people use today.

The breakthrough was made using a special kind of fiber optic cable that has 19 separate cores. These cores allow data to travel in multiple streams at the same time, much like a superhighway with 19 lanes. Even though it’s much more powerful, the cable is the same size as regular fiber lines, making it easier to use with existing technology.

The team tested this high-speed connection over a long distance—more than 1,800 kilometers—without losing speed or quality. This means it could be useful for long-range data transfer, such as across countries or under the ocean.

While this ultra-fast internet isn’t available to the public yet, it shows what might be possible in the near future. It could play a big role in future technologies like 6G, global cloud services, and AI systems that need to move massive amounts of data instantly.

Lyrics
[Intro: 50 Cent]
Somethin' special
Unforgettable
50 Cent (Cent)
Justin ('tin)
Timbaland ('land)
Godd***, d***

[Bridge: 50 Cent]
She, she, she want it, I wanna give it to her
She know that it's right here for her
I wanna see her break it down (Yeah)
I'm ballin', throwing money 'round

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
She a working girl, she work the pole
She break it down, she take it low
She fine as h***, she 'bout the dough
She doing her thing out on the floor
Her money-money, she make it, make it
Look at the way she shake it, shake it
Make you wanna touch it, make you wanna taste it
Have you lusting for it, going crazy, face it
Now don't stop, get it, get it
The way she shake it make you wanna hit it
Think she double-jointed from the way she split it
Got your head f***ed up from the way she did it
She so much more than you used to
She know just how to move to seduce you
She gon' do the right thing and touch the right spots
And dance in your lap 'til you ready to pop

[Bridge: 50 Cent & Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
She always ready, when you want it, she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I'll show you where to meet her
On the late night, 'til daylight, the club jumping
If you want a good time, she gon' give you what you want
Let me talk to you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You got me saying, ""Ayo!"" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you, girl

[Verse 2: 50 Cent; 50 Cent w/ Justin Timberlake; Justin Timberlake]
Got a thing for that thing she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this b**** 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that—that there should be 'gainst the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, d***, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin', shawty, we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Let me talk to you

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new-age, you're like my new craze
Let's get together, maybe we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy
Spotlights don't do you justice, baby
Why don't you come over here?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You got me saying, ""Ayo!"" I'm tired of using technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo! I'm tired of using technology
I need you right in front of me
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her
Ooh, she wants it, ugh, ugh, she wants it
Ooh, she wants it (So) I gotta give it to her

[Post-Chorus: Timbaland]
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you girl",Loku,2022-11-27T07:51:35Z,1025067,12744,257,technology

I welcome any feedback on my videos or the channel in general in the comments. See below for more on this.

Product Sourcing:

When it comes to sourcing a product for review, I will usually either  purchase and item personally or reach out to a supplier requesting a sample for review.  Many suppliers are supportive if they are confident in their product, appreciating the value of greater exposure.

Any sponsored videos (paid for reviews) are clearly stated as such so there can be no misunderstanding.

If a product I have reviewed is available from Amazon I will often include an Amazon link in the description.  As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. If you purchase a product or service with the links that I provide I may receive a small commission. There is no additional charge to you.

Replying to Comments:

I really appreciate the feedback in the comments - I find it a source of knowledge and inspiration - so thank you to all of you who take the time to contribute.  This is not just for me as the creator, it is a valuable source of information for all readers of the comments.  I have recently found that if I continue to respond to all the comments as the number of videos builds, it takes significant time away from being able to produce new content which would be very counter productive! So my aim is to read everything I can and reply when I can, after each video goes live for the first few hours at least, and beyond that when possible.  I'll see how that works out 😊

Please consider subscribing and being notified to keep up to date with new video releases.

Thank you for supporting the channel.

f3c4mQty_so,I Tried the First Humanoid Home Robot. It Got Weird. | WSJ,"The 1X Neo is one of the first humanoid robots built for your home and is equipped with full AI software. For $20,000, you can pre-order X1’s Neo now with delivery set for 2026. But a company representative might need to peer into your home, via Neo’s camera eyes, to help get things done. 

WSJ’s Joanna Stern spent time with it—and its creator—to see what it can really do and how much it still requires a human operator’s help.

Chapters:
0:00 The first humanoid home robot
0:37 Neo’s body (hardware) and safety challenges
3:27 Neo’s brain (teleoperation vs. autonomy) 
7:11 Neo’s usefulness vs. privacy tradeoff
8:11 Neo’s future 

Watch the full interview with 1X CEO Bernt Bornich here: https://youtu.be/NIHU7Y8-8k4

Tech Things With Joanna Stern
Everything is now a tech thing. In creative and humorous videos, WSJ senior personal tech columnist Joanna Stern explains and reviews the products, services and trends that are changing our world.
