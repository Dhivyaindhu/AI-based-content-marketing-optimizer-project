  Loop marketing represents a fundamental shift from traditional linear funnels to a continuous growth engine, where every customer interaction creates expansion opportunities. Companies practicing loop marketing — whether through growth marketing strategies, behavioral marketing triggers, or integrated offline marketing touchpoints — transform one-time buyers into active participants who fuel sustainable business growth.  Loop Marketing is HubSpot’s four-stage framework for compounding growth through connected customer experiences that generate momentum at each stage. Unlike closed-loop marketing, which tracks attribution, proper Loop Marketing creates self-reinforcing cycles where satisfied customers naturally drive online word-of-mouth marketing, product adoption spreads organically, and each completed loop strengthens the next. For companies ready to implement these strategies, HubSpot’s Loop Marketing Playbook provides the tactical framework to identify, build, and optimize growth loops that transform customer success into sustainable business expansion. Moreover, this article will break down real-world Loop examples and demonstrate how to replicate their success using HubSpot’s Smart CRM. Table of Contents: Loop Marketing is HubSpot’s four-stage, AI-enabled framework that creates compounding growth through continuous customer engagement cycles rather than one-way funnel progression. Unlike traditional marketing funnels, where customers exit after purchase, loop marketing transforms every interaction into fuel for the next cycle, building momentum that accelerates with each completion. The Loop Marketing framework directly connects to established growth loop principles pioneered by companies like Dropbox and Slack, while also incorporating systematic AI integration and measurable compounding effects at each stage. The Loop Marketing framework operates through four interconnected stages that form a complete system:  The ‘Express’ stage of Loop Marketing defines brand identity and ideal customer profile (ICP) while establishing the foundational messaging that resonates with target audiences. Then, its ‘Tailor’ stage of Loop Marketing personalizes content and experiences using AI-powered insights from previous loop completions, creating increasingly relevant touchpoints for each segment. Next, the ‘Amplify’ stage of Loop distributes content across channels, creators, and AI engines, leveraging both owned and earned media to maximize reach and engagement. Lastly, the ‘Evolve’ stage analyzes performance data and customer feedback to optimize future loops, ensuring each cycle performs better than the last. The shift to loop marketing addresses three critical limitations of funnel-based approaches: Loop Marketing is a new way to grow — powered by humans and AI, working together to express your message, tailor it to your audience, amplify it across channels, and evolve it in real time.

Loop Marketing addresses these challenges by treating every customer as both a beneficiary and a contributor to growth, creating network effects where success with one customer directly improves outcomes for subsequent customers. Pro Tip: HubSpot’s pre-existing, CRM-specific tools are well-suited for Loop Marketing tactics:  Source As the company that coined “Loop Marketing,” HubSpot’s approach to its own methodology is as follows: its free CRM creates a usage-based expansion loop, where initial adoption naturally reveals the need for advanced features. Additionally, by combining human authenticity with AI efficiency, HubSpot enhances customer lifetime value, organic growth velocity, and platform adoption depth. Here’s a closer look at HubSpot’s Loop Marketing approach: Here’s how marketing teams can replicate HubSpot’s approach to Loop Marketing with its tools:  Source Instagram transforms every posted photo into discovery fuel through hashtags, location tags, and its Explore page algorithm, creating a self-reinforcing content ecosystem where creation drives discovery. Additionally, by combining human creativity with Meta AI’s sophisticated recommendation engine, Instagram ensures that genuine moments reach the right audiences while AI-powered features like automatic alt-text, content suggestions, and Smart Reply maintain accessibility and engagement at scale. Instagram’s approach to Loop Marketing works like this: Here’s how marketing teams can replicate Instagram’s approach to Loop Marketing with HubSpot:  Source Slack’s version of Loop Marketing seems to operate on team-level network effects. Each new team member adds value to communication for all existing members, resulting in faster adoption rates compared to top-down software deployment. By combining human-centered collaboration with Slack’s AI intelligent automation — including automated summaries, smart search, and workflow builder — Slack ensures authentic team interactions scale efficiently while AI handles repetitive tasks that would otherwise create friction. More specifically, Slack’s approach to Loop Marketing works like this: Here’s how marketing teams can replicate Slack’s version of the Loop Marketing methodology: Pro Tip: HubSpot’s account-based marketing tools, combined with its Breeze AI, automatically trigger multi-touch campaigns that encourage team-wide adoption before customers even request additional seats.  Source Dropbox’s execution of Loop Marketing resembles an engineered bidirectional referral loop, where both the referrer and referee receive free storage, aligning user incentives with company growth while addressing the cold start problem through the immediate provision of tangible value. By combining genuine user need with AI-powered intelligence — including smart sync, intelligent file suggestions, and automated organization — Dropbox ensures that storage becomes more valuable as users add more content, making referrals feel like helpful recommendations rather than marketing tactics. More specifically, Dropbox’s approach to Loop Marketing works like this: Here’s how marketing teams can replicate Dropbox’s approach to Loop Marketing with HubSpot: Loop Marketing is a new way to grow — powered by humans and AI, working together to express your message, tailor it to your audience, amplify it across channels, and evolve it in real time.

At the same time, power users can build increasingly sophisticated systems that feel personally crafted. Here’s how Notion’s approach to Loop Marketing works: Here’s how marketing teams can replicate components of Notion’s approach to Loop Marketing with HubSpot:  Source Duolingo’s approach to Loop Marketing involves a streak system that transforms language learning into a social commitment device where daily practice generates shareable achievements that create accountability pressure and competitive dynamics. By combining human motivation psychology with AI-powered personalization — including adaptive lesson difficulty, optimal reminder timing, and GPT-4-powered conversations — Duolingo ensures that learning feels personally tailored while maintaining the social dynamics that drive users to practice daily. Take a closer look at Duolingo’s approach to the Loop Marketing methodology: Here’s how marketing teams can replicate elements of Duolingo’s approach to Loop Marketing with HubSpot:  LinkedIn’s execution of Loop Marketing appears to be driven by engagement through profile completion gamification; each added detail enhances search visibility, match quality, and network recommendations, creating compound value from incremental actions. By combining professional identity with AI-powered optimization — including skills assessments, content recommendations, and recruitment algorithms — LinkedIn ensures that profile building feels like genuine career development. At the same time, the platform’s AI maximizes the professional opportunities each data point creates. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of LinkedIn’s approach to Loop Marketing: Here’s how marketing teams can recreate aspects of LinkedIn’s approach to Loop Marketing with HubSpot:  Source Uber’s implementation of Loop Marketing looks like in-app surge pricing, creating self-balancing loops where price signals redistribute supply and demand in real-time, using economic incentives to solve marketplace imbalances without manual intervention. By combining human decision-making autonomy with AI-powered market predictions, including demand forecasting, route optimization, and dynamic pricing algorithms, Uber ensures that drivers maintain their independence. At the same time, AI orchestrates system-wide efficiency, making every ride feel personally chosen rather than algorithmically assigned. Here’s a more detailed explanation of Uber’s execution of Loop Marketing: Here’s how marketing teams can replicate Uber’s Loop Marketing strategy with HubSpot: Loop Marketing is a new way to grow — powered by humans and AI, working together to express your message, tailor it to your audience, amplify it across channels, and evolve it in real time. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Loop marketing is HubSpot’s four-stage framework (Express, Tailor, Amplify, Evolve) that creates continuous growth cycles, where each customer interaction strengthens the next. In contrast, traditional funnels guide customers through linear stages, culminating in a purchase. Funnels operate on a one-way path, where customers enter at the awareness stage and exit after conversion, necessitating ongoing new lead generation to sustain growth. Loop marketing transforms customers into active participants who: Each completed loop reduces customer acquisition costs while increasing lifetime value. As previously mentioned, Spotify’s “Wrapped” campaign exemplifies Loop Marketing by transforming user listening data into shareable social content that drives organic brand mentions and social posts annually, creating new user acquisition while deepening existing engagement. Additionally, Notion built a template-sharing loop where users create workspace templates that serve as discovery mechanisms for new users, who then create their own templates, thereby expanding the product’s use cases and reach exponentially. Start by mapping your existing customer journey to identify where natural loop opportunities exist — moments where customer success creates shareable outcomes, data insights, or network effects. Then, define clear triggers and rewards at each stage: Build the minimum viable loop first by focusing on one high-impact cycle — typically product usage data that improves recommendations or customer success stories that drive referrals — then layer additional loops as the foundation strengthens. Content loops transform user-generated content or behavioral data into valuable resources that attract new users while engaging existing ones. That said, review platforms, community forums, and collaborative tools excel in this area. Viral loops incentivize sharing through reciprocal value, where both referrer and referred benefit, achieving viral coefficients above 1.0 when properly designed. However, data loops utilize aggregated customer insights to enhance: All of this creates competitive moats that strengthen with scale. Social loops leverage network effects where product value increases with user count — messaging platforms, marketplaces, and collaboration tools naturally create these compounding dynamics. First, track loop velocity by measuring time from initial engagement through complete cycle completion — successful loops show decreasing cycle times as optimization improves. Then, monitor the loop multiplier effect: how many new participants each completed loop generates through referrals, content creation, or network expansion — healthy loops achieve multipliers above 1.5. Afterwards, measure compounding metrics, including: Loop marketing requires a sufficient transaction frequency or engagement depth to generate meaningful data and behavioral patterns; single-purchase, low-engagement products struggle to create sustainable loops. Industries with strict regulatory constraints surrounding data sharing, customer communications, or referral incentives may find loop mechanisms to be legally restricted or economically unviable. Conversely, early-stage companies without product-market fit should focus on a fundamental value proposition before building loops, as loops amplify existing dynamics but cannot create demand where none exists. Lastly, B2B enterprises with lengthy and complex sales cycles may find it more complicated to establish loop dynamics than relationship-based account expansion strategies. Begin with micro-loops focused on your most engaged users, rather than trying to activate your entire base. Identify the top 10% who already exhibit loop-like behaviors, such as: Next, leverage partner loops by integrating with platforms that already have network effects, allowing you to tap into existing loop dynamics while building your own audience. Then, create artificial initial velocity through manual processes that simulate loop outcomes by personally facilitating introductions or creating initial content yourself. These efforts will generate the success stories and data insights needed to automate future loops. Overall, focus on quality over quantity by optimizing for loop completion rate rather than volume, as 100 users completing loops generates more sustainable growth than 1,000 users starting but abandoning them. The shift to loop marketing represents more than tactical optimization; it’s a strategic imperative for driving personalization at scale. And, most importantly, the numbers exemplify this. According to HubSpot’s 2025 Loop Marketing Report, 93% of U.S. marketers who use some level of personalization or segmentation in their marketing say it has a moderate to high positive impact on marketing-driven leads or purchases. The companies profiled in this article demonstrate a fundamental truth: sustainable growth no longer comes from pushing customers through linear funnels but from creating self-reinforcing systems where every interaction compounds future success.

  In today’s fast-moving go-to-market environment, workflow automation is about removing friction, reducing human error, and scaling personalized customer journeys across your revenue functions, from marketing and sales to service and operations.  In my experience leading demand gen and marketing ops teams, I’ve seen the biggest performance lifts come from automating the invisible work: lead handoffs, data enrichment, routing, follow-ups, and reporting. When automation is thoughtfully designed and built with AI-augmented workflows embedded in your systems, your teams make better decisions with fewer resources and in less time. So let’s explore how workflow automation works, where it applies, and which tools are best-in-class. Table of Contents At its core, workflow automation is about designing repeatable, rule-based systems that reduce manual effort, eliminate bottlenecks, and increase consistency across your go-to-market motions. In today’s AI-powered marketing environment, that definition expands. It’s not just about removing repetitive tasks from marketers’ daily workloads. It’s about augmenting your workflows with AI to make them more predictive and personalized. What does that mean in practice? Instead of relying solely on rules-based logic, modern automation uses AI to understand context (e.g., buyer behavior, persona, funnel stage) and adjust the next best action dynamically. Think of examples such as: In this sense, AI-augmented workflow automation is bringing workflow automation from a backend ops function to a frontline growth lever, enabling marketing teams to do more with less. Measure the performance of all your marketing campaigns in one place with built-in analytics, reports, and dashboards. Traditionally, workflow automation is done through a series of if/then statements that trigger specific actions based on behavior. Let’s walk through a classic example: A website visitor submits a form. Here’s what a classic workflow can look like from start to finish in HubSpot automation.  This type of linear, rules-based flow is still foundational, but it’s no longer the ceiling. In today’s modern B2B marketing, AI-augmented workflows that can adapt in real time are increasingly taking center stage in workflow automation. In practice, that means: Almost every department can benefit from this shift. Marketing can use automation to nurture leads and hand off clean data to sales; sales accelerates follow-up and prioritizes better; customer success stays ahead of renewal; even finance and HR use it to streamline internal approvals and onboarding. In the next section, we’ll explore real-world examples of how teams use workflow automation. Workflow automation can be used in virtually any team and in any business scenario. While it’s mostly related to marketing and sales, it can also be used in customer service, operations, human resources, and finance.  Some of the most repetitive tasks in marketing, such as sending emails and posting social media updates, can be automated with workflow automation. With marketing automation software, you can schedule your entire social media calendar and set up workflows that nurture certain types of prospects with email offers. In practice, AI workflow automation drafts copy while timing messages from behavior patterns, which keeps nurturing tracks relevant through ongoing lead scoring. Automated workflows in marketing include:  Source Sales workflow automation streamlines tedious lead and prospect management tasks, so that reps can focus on selling, not entering data. Aside from taking leads automatically through the pipeline based on their actions, an automated sales workflow can enroll prospects in drip campaigns and update deal stages as the deal moves forward. Automated tasks in sales include:  Source Workflow automation is incredibly useful in customer service. Aside from launching surveys, workflow automation can take care of tickets, cases, and common questions by sending a series of emails or creating tasks. Automated tasks in customer service include:  Source Operations is the lifeblood of any organization, and it, too, can be automated to reduce instances of manual data entry. Automated tasks in operations include: Measure the performance of all your marketing campaigns in one place with built-in analytics, reports, and dashboards. Instead of having to manually enter all your new hires’ personal information — like addresses, social security numbers, and other employee information into payroll, expense, and insurance systems — HR automation software can do it for you in minutes. Automated tasks in human resources include:  Source By allowing you to build forms, design workflows, and track processes, finance process automation software can streamline all of your travel requests, reimbursements, and budget approvals. Automated tasks in finance include: Now that you know everything about using automated workflows, let’s take a look at the top tools you can use. For more practical examples, I shared some tactical ways marketers can use to build smarter workflows. From setting up smart lists to building lead recycling logic, small wins today often become big lifts tomorrow.  Get started with HubSpot now. HubSpot’s marketing, sales, service, and operations software operates on a single platform, making it one of the best choices for all-in-one workflow automation. Everything is linked together, allowing you to align all of your teams’ processes and to reduce friction from task to task. You can easily hand leads from marketing to sales, connect a service ticket with an existing contact record, and clean up customer data — all in one user-friendly platform. And you can connect HubSpot CRM with over 50 different workflow integrations available within the HubSpot App Marketplace. Best for: I highly recommend HubSpot for growing businesses that have yet to try workflow automation and for enterprise businesses with established processes. You can begin with a Starter subscription, then upgrade as you require more functionalities. Especially recommended for marketing, sales, service, and operations departments. Pricing for Marketing Hub: Free; $9 per month/seat (Starter); $800/month (Professional); $3,600/month (Enterprise). Pricing for Sales Hub: Free; $9 per month/seat (Starter); $90 per month/seat (Professional); $150/month/seat (Enterprise). Pricing for Service Hub: Free; $9 per month/seat (Starter); $90 per month/seat (Professional); $150 per month/seat (Enterprise). Pricing for Data Hub (previously Operations Hub): Free; $9 per month/seat (Starter); $720/month (Professional); $2,000/month (Enterprise). Zapier remains one of the most accessible no-code automation platforms for connecting disparate systems. According to Zapier’s own stats, users have created over 25 million “Zaps,” and it boasts tens of thousands of app integrations.  Source More recently, Zapier has positioned itself as a Gen AI orchestration engine via features like “AI Actions” or “Zapier Agents,” enabling workflows to auto‑summarize, classify, and trigger follow‑ups using LLMs. Best for: Perfect for scrappy or experimental teams who want to quickly spin up AI-enhanced workflows without heavy engineering, especially when you have multiple tools already and need to “connect the dots.” Why I recommend it: In my experience working with growth‑stage SaaS companies, Zapier has been invaluable for experimentation before migrating critical workflows into the MAP/CRM. For example, I once built a workflow where inbound leads were enriched, scored, and routed within 30 minutes of submission using Zapier linked with LLM for persona classification. Pricing: Free Forever. Paid plans start at $19.99/month (Professional); $69/month (Team); custom pricing for Enterprise. Make offers a visual automation canvas that supports multi‑step workflows, complex branching logic, and recently added AI agent capabilities, making it a robust choice when “if/then” logic isn’t enough.  Source Why I recommend it: I used Make to automate a lead‑nurture campaign across personas. The logic required multiple branches and timed waits that Make handled smoothly. Pricing: Free (1,000 credits for the month). Paid plans start at $9 per month. Core costs $16 per month for Pro and $29 per month for teams, with custom pricing available for Enterprise. Clay is a Gen AI‑native workflow builder designed for account‑based enrichment, outbound personalization, and signal‑driven orchestration. It can connect to your CRM, enrichment providers (e.g., Apollo), and intent databases. Clay also applies AI to dynamically trigger outreach. One distinctive advantage of Clay is that it ties signal detection, enrichment, and personalization into one flow, which improves the ROI in GTM teams tremendously.  Best for: GTM teams focus on outbound and need a strong layer of buying signals, like “job opening in target account,” “funding event,” or “tech stack change.” Clay is great for teams who want to use those signals to automate personalized outreach across multiple personas. Pricing: Free; $134/month (Starter); $314/month (Explorer); $720/month (Pro); custom pricing for Enterprise. Tray is an enterprise‑grade workflow and automation platform built for highly technical users. Unlike no‑code tools, Tray offers deep integration, complex loops, nested logic, and full visibility into data models.  Source Best for: Organizations with complex needs: many systems, regulatory requirements, multiple workflows, and a full dev team. Ideal when you need detailed control over data flows, custom ETL, or integrations that go beyond typical SaaS connectors. Why I recommend it: I implemented workflows in Tray.ai for an enterprise GTM stack. Despite the initial steeper learning curve, it handles scenarios such as multi‑region and multi-business units data routing, heavy volume processing, and orchestration smoothly. Pricing: They offer three tiers — Pro, Team, and Enterprise. Call sales for details. OpenAI Agent Builder is a visual drag‑and‑drop interface from OpenAI that lets you build custom AI agents combining logic nodes, data connectors, and workflow steps. While it’s still evolving, it represents a next‑gen frontier of “automation + intelligence” that is worth marketers keeping an eye on.  Best for: Organizations with established automation footprints and internal resources that can invest in AI workflow design. Pricing: Contact sales. There’s no one workflow automation tool that fits everything. You should choose based on your stage, stack, and GTM complexity. Whichever you choose, always remember to pair it with solid data management practice and clearly defined business rules. As AI becomes more embedded in marketing, the most effective marketing teams will be those who treat automation as an always-on co-pilot. Whether you're using powerful tools like HubSpot to build no-code workflows or leveraging customized AI agents to manage highly advanced flows at scale, here are some strategy tips: Want to explore how AI-powered workflows can power your GTM orchestration?

  Perhaps you’ve heard that Taylor Swift recently released a new album, The Life of a Showgirl. Not only did the full-length smash sales records, but it also spawned endless musical analysis (Who exactly is “Father Figure” about?) and viral moments (Is the mystery of the orange door actually solved?).  Of course, Swift’s marketing savvy is as impressive as her musical talent. The album rollout also illustrated Swift’s knack for promotion — and underscored why she’s a once-in-a-generation pop star. Although not everyone can land a No. 1 album or launch a sold-out stadium tour, all is not lost: You can still keep it 100 in your own business with these marketing lessons gleaned from Taylor Swift.  Illustration by Olivia Heller Swift is known for her loyalty to her devoted fans, the Swifties. Years ago, she randomly showed up at a wedding shower she was invited to, and bought Christmas gifts for other followers. Before releasing her reputation and Lover albums, she held Secret Sessions, where she premiered the record (and ate homemade goodies) with hand-picked groups of uber-fans. These experiences made her followers feel unique and special — and cemented their fandom for life. With each Swift album era, fans can expect certain things: exclusive vinyl variants, a different color scheme (The Life of a Showgirl is dazzling orange and cool mint green) and special merch options (including a unique cardigan and snow globe). This method appeals to collectors, sure — but also shows the ways Swift’s career builds on itself over time. Customers appreciate a business that’s predictable and reliable. It’s easy to lose track of what content you have (or want) to share. A structured content marketing strategy, which could include things such as a content calendar, can help you see what’s missing and what’s successful. As a true millennial, Swift was quite active on MySpace and loved to share her life via video blogs or diary entries. Once her career took off, she didn’t use social media as much, but when she did, her personality shone through. After all, only Taylor would accidentally take her parents to a Las Vegas club. Swift’s fandom is rife with lore. (Exhibit A: The “No, it’s Becky” meme.) But even if you’re not an OG fan who saw her open for Rascal Flatts in 2006, you’re not excluded from the fandom. If anything, long-time loyalists want to bring everyone into the fold, whether it’s Taylor Tots (the term for adorable toddler Swifties) or recent converts. Swift is clearly the same way: For example, the viral TikTok dance for “The Fate of Ophelia” isn’t overly complicated — and you can even do it sitting down!

  At 29, I wasn’t just finalizing a divorce. I was entering a new era of contractual self-protection. That meant completely rewiring how I think about partnership, boundaries, and my own value. When you go through something like marriage fraud, you learn firsthand that love without legal protection can cost you more than heartbreak. It can cost you your peace, your assets, and your sense of control. That experience completely changed how I approach contracts, not just in relationships, but in business. Today, as a content creator, marketer, and former Wall Street professional, I review contracts the same way I now view marriage: No partnership should begin without clarity, accountability, and protection. Table of Contents HubSpot's Annual Inbound Marketing Trends Report All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. When I got married, I didn’t have a prenup. Like many women, I thought that asking for one would make me look pessimistic or distrustful. But here’s the truth: Contracts aren’t about distrust. They’re about discipline. A prenup outlines the terms of a partnership. That includes financial commitments, responsibility, and potential dissolution. It’s not romantic, but it’s real. Looking back, I wish I had included certain clauses, specifically an infidelity clause that would have created financial accountability for betrayal and a reputational protection clause that safeguarded my public image in the event of deceit. My divorce didn’t just teach me about love. It taught me about leverage. What I learned transformed how I now approach my brand partnerships. When someone lies in a marriage, you realize how much damage can happen when transparency is missing. When a brand violates a contract or delays payment, the principle is the same: Integrity without enforcement means nothing. Today, I’m more intentional with every collaboration. I’m involved in every step — from legal review to creative concept. I’ve learned that being hands-on isn’t controlling. It’s conscious. My credibility has only grown since I adopted this approach. Brands trust me because I’m direct. My audience trusts me because I’m transparent. And I trust myself because I now know how to protect my name, my likeness, and my work. That approach has landed me authentic brand deals that align with my story. Almost poetically, my recent partnership with Hulu for their show All’s Fair, which follows powerful female divorce attorneys, brought everything full circle. I broke down three prenup clauses that I would never let love talk me out of again: an infidelity clause, a financial infidelity clause, and a reputational protection clause. Those clauses weren’t hypothetical. They were lessons I earned the hard way. And the irony is, the same protections that would have safeguarded me in marriage are the same protections every creator needs in business. Infidelity clauses mirror exclusivity clauses. Financial infidelity parallels late-payment and transparency clauses. And, reputational protection is the exact kind of clause that keeps creators safe if a brand missteps. The overlap is real, and it’s why I take contracts so seriously across every area of my life now. Because at the end of the day, both marriage and marketing rely on the same thing: trust backed by terms.  In the social media industry, creators often jump into partnerships based on opportunity and excitement. But just like in relationships, emotion without structure is dangerous. I’ve learned that a well-written contract is an act of self-respect. It says, I value my work enough to protect it. When I negotiate with brands now, I think of it as a business marriage — one that should be clear about expectations, timelines, and boundaries. That means my contracts have clauses to keep me protected. These clauses aren’t just about money. They’re about protecting the value I bring to the table. Here are a few clauses I always pay attention to. The creative industry is notorious for late payments. So, I include a late payment clause that ensures compensation for every day past the agreed-upon date. It’s not about greed. I want to make sure that partners are accountable and uphold their end of the bargain. Usage rights spell out how the content I make will be used by the brand I’m partnering with. I always make sure to ask: These details determine the value of the partnership. A one-time Instagram post is not the same as perpetual paid usage across global channels. Exclusivity clauses are the business version of fidelity. If a skincare brand pays me to represent them exclusively, that means I can’t promote other skincare brands during that term. And if I did, there would be a financial consequence. It’s no different from an infidelity clause in a marriage contract. I like to say, “If he breaks the vows, he should break bread.” Likewise, in business, if you break your promise, you should pay the penalty. Liability and reputation clauses are the parts of a contract that protect creators from being blamed, sued, or financially harmed because of something a brand does. You’ll usually see this language appear as As a creator, your image is your asset. You can’t afford to be collateral damage in someone else’s downfall. The biggest misconception I see in the creator industry is that your lawyer should handle everything. Yes, you need legal representation, but you also need literacy. As a woman in business, I never want to sign something I don’t understand. I want to know every clause, every term, and every implication. I want to know what happens if a brand doesn’t pay on time, if content is repurposed without approval, or if a campaign gets canceled after deliverables are completed. When I worked on Wall Street, I had to analyze market data and client mandates in meticulous detail before moving forward on any transaction. I bring that same rigor and attention to detail to my work as a creator. Whether it’s a Wall Street firm or a beauty campaign, the foundation is the same: Protect your interests, define your obligations, and anchor your worth in clear terms. In reality, social media marketing is still a young industry. It hasn’t yet survived a full economic cycle or a recession. The lack of structure and precedent makes contracts even more critical. You can’t afford to assume “things will just work out.” Hope is not a legal strategy. Here are the lessons I carry with me: My divorce at 29 forced me to rethink not just how I love, but how I lead. It taught me that contracts, whether personal or professional, are not about expecting failure. They’re about creating safety, clarity, and respect. In both business and life, people will test boundaries. But when your terms are clear, your protections are in place, and your value is documented, you don’t just preserve your peace. You protect your power. HubSpot's Annual Inbound Marketing Trends Report All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time.

Dollars to doughnuts, here's what marketers can learn from Ohio's first and only doughnut bar, no matter your industry Updated: 
  
    
  
  
  
    11/14/25
  

  “It's not enough to be a hospitality business anymore,” small-business owner Shelley Pippin says. “You need to be an event business.”  Here’s why Brewnuts has been so successful at using events to carve out a niche for themselves, and what small- and medium-sized business marketers can learn from “Ohio’s first and only doughnut bar,” regardless of your industry. When you think of bar food, you probably think of things like burgers and sandwiches. But Cleveland-based Brewnuts has a different vision: As Brewnuts’ “Ohio's first and only doughnut bar,” as co-owner and founder Shelley Pippin puts it, the business pairs a carefully curated selection of beer and coffee drinks with a rotating selection of homemade doughnuts. For Brewnuts, their menu is just the (sweet) start, however. “It's not enough to be a hospitality business anymore,” Pippin says. “You need to be an event business.”  In addition to a menu of brews and dones, Brewnuts books weekends celebrating holidays (Halloween), pop culture (Twilight) and fandom lore (an annual December toast to Taylor Swift’s birthday called “Taylor Fest”). These special events often come with unique coffee drinks or theme-specific doughnuts; for example, a “Boston Scream!” for spooky season.  Photo credit: Emily Drapp “I love creating things, and I see my job as being responsible for surprising and delighting people,” Pippin says. “That's why I love the hospitality industry. It’s a place where you have the opportunity to create experiences for people. It really is about providing that little slice of escape and joy.” Takeaway: Don’t underestimate the power of surprise, delight, and joy. Whether you’re selling doughnuts or databases, think about what experiences you can create for people. Pippin cut her teeth working in partnership marketing, sponsorships, and client work, so she excels at handling the creative ideation side of Brewnuts — a job that encompasses things such as menu development, event planning, and social media content creation.  Photo credit: Shelley Pippin “I love the inspiration part,” she says. “Those things tend to just pop into my brain, and I‘m like, ‘Yep, and here’s 25 ideas about how I want to do that.’” But from a business standpoint, Brewnuts is well balanced because co-founder (and Pippin’s husband) John has a background in accounting and finance. “He handles a lot more of our operations,” she says. “It‘s great to have all the ideas in the world. But if you don’t understand how to run a functional business in terms of making the numbers work, it's all for naught.” Takeaway: Even the scrappiest marketing team can’t do it all. Lean into your strengths, and join forces with co-workers (or co-founders) who will provide some balance. Pippin will work with one of the doughnut decorators (who happens to be a talented photographer) on graphics and promotional materials. Otherwise, she doesn’t outsource the marketing activities because she has a specific vision for Brewnuts’ brand voice — and knows it works. “When I want to hype something, I want to hype it in a certain way, and I want people to feel a certain amount of energy about it,” she says. “At this point, I haven't found a way to communicate that to someone else.” This confidence translates to event planning. For instance, although the annual Taylor Fests have become bigger and bigger each year (just like Swift’s career!) Pippin wrote the 2025 iteration of the menu in August in about half an hour.  Photo credit: Shelley Pippin “If I‘m getting that excited about it, I don’t second guess it,” she says of planning these larger-scale events. “If it‘s something that I’m having a whole lot of creativity around, that tends to tell me everything I need to know, because I know there's probably other people out there that are going to feel that same way.” Takeaway: Data is important, but it’s not everything. Sometimes you gotta go with your gut. If you’re having a hard time persuading your boss that your excitement merits a budget, follow Pippin’s lead and start small. Pilot your idea, measure the ROI, and grow a little bigger each year.  Brewnuts incorporates customer passions into their marketing strategy. Over the years, they’ve planned events centered around The Office, Star Wars, and Home Alone. However, Brewnuts’ events and marketing come from a place of sincerity — and inclusion. “We really made a point to plant our flag and say what we’re about, and be clear about our values, and [that we’re] about being a space for the whole community,” Pippin says.  Photo credit: Emily Drapp This mindset also explains why Brewnuts is thoughtful (and deliberate) about the events they plan, including by making sure their interests and passions align with what guests want. “We‘ve had things come up where people say, ‘Why don’t you do an XYZ weekend?’” Pippin says. “I don‘t necessarily want to do that if it’s something that we don’t have a true fans’ perspective on.” Takeaway: You don’t have to jump on every trend. As tempting as it might be to do a Star Wars tie-in for your tech company, if it doesn’t reflect your values or build community, it’s okay to skip this one. Pippin and her husband are hands-on owners who stay connected to guests via many different channels. For example, Brewnuts sends out a monthly newsletter and maintains a robust social media presence. “We‘re definitely not absentee owners,” Pippin says. “We’re very much present in our space and in our social media.” By staying so connected, Brewnuts has a deeper understanding of their audience — and how to reach new customers. “In a lot of ways, we try to throw events that are for groups of people that maybe don't feel like they have a home base,” Pippin says. “I like trying to spot niche groups that maybe feel, like, ‘Hey, nobody throws an event for us.’” At the end of the day, Pippin stresses the importance of gratitude and shares that she never takes any support for granted. “It is never lost on me that someone is choosing to spend their hard-earned money at my place,” she says. “[This] is really important to keep in the forefront at all times.”  Takeaway: Maintain a hospitality mindset. Brewnuts doesn’t throw events just for the sake of having a Halloween tie-in; it uses newsletters, social media, and customer interactions to segment its consumers and make them feel welcome.

  When I first started at HubSpot, I needed a new headshot fast. So, I turned to generative AI tools — and no one had any idea, at least not initially. Love ‘em or hate ‘em, generative AI tools are impressive.  From text and data analysis to uncanny photos and celebrity videos, AI’s ability to imitate human voices and forms has improved dramatically in the past year. While they raise a lot of ethical questions, they can also help increase productivity and amplify marketing results when used strategically. Manufacturer Cold Jet, for instance, cut lead response time by 66% using HubSpot’s Smart CRM and Breeze. But what generative AI tools should your team use? In this article, we’ll discuss: Table of Contents Ideate, create, and share content. Easily create... Generative AI tools for marketing are software solutions that create content (i.e. videos, images, text, graphs), campaigns, and insights using artificial intelligence. Marketers use these tools to speed up content creation, personalize messaging, and improve campaign results across email, ads, social, SEO, and analytics. To choose the right tools, look for options that integrate with your CRM, support brand voice controls, and offer strong data privacy. Start with a shortlist, run pilot tests, and roll out gradually. Want to see how AI can work for your team? Get a demo or start free with HubSpot’s AI-powered marketing tools. Generative AI tools are software solutions that use large-language models (LLMs) or multimodal AI to create new content based on prompts, inputs, or data. Finished products can include text, imagery, video, audio, reports, code, or even ideas. But how can marketers make use of this? Generative AI is useful across numerous marketing channels: Thanks to generative AI tools, marketing teams report reducing content creation time by three hours per piece without sacrificing quality standards. (The most important thing to me.) The shift from hours to minutes for first drafts means marketers spend more time on strategy and less on production. Here at HubSpot, this idea is at the heart of Loop Marketing.  Not every AI tool fits every team or task. Before adopting new platforms, evaluate them against these practical criteria to figure out if it's really what you need,  List your top marketing objectives. What exactly are you trying to achieve? This will help you understand what areas you want to focus on improving and where AI may be able to help. For example, when I needed a headshot, I knew I had to focus on tools that had the best reputation for creating realistic photos. Does this tool connect to your CRM, marketing automation platform, and content management system? Can it pull data from your existing tools to make informed suggestions? Even the best AI needs this data to create the most effective and relevant content. HubSpot has its own AI, Breeze, but it also offers integrations with other tools, such as Claude. This enables not just data access but also automation. Does this generative AI tool have everything you need? With your goals, industry, and workflow in mind, here are some specifics to pay attention to: HubSpot’s Breeze does all of these things. Ideate, create, and share content. Easily create... Will this tool grow with your organization (aka does it have what you need right now and more)? And if so, will you still be able to afford it then? Many platforms appear affordable at low contact or usage volumes but become expensive as usage increases. Ensure that the tool you’re considering will remain realistic and useful in the future. Everything can look great on paper, but you won’t truly know until it’s in practice. So, take some time (2-4 weeks) to pilot or demo different generative AI tools to make sure they work and fit into your processes as expected. During this time, run these three marketing fit pilots: Different AI tools solve different problems. Here's how to match your goals to high-impact use cases: Marketing teams juggle multiple responsibilities across multiple channels: ideation, production, approval, and distribution. Generative AI and content operations platforms can help streamline every step of this workflow. This is what that can look like at a high level:  Source Email remains one of marketing's highest-ROI channels, and AI makes it even more powerful. Marketing automation platforms with built-in AI capabilities help teams personalize at scale. Core email AI use cases: HubSpot's AI Email Writer provides practical next steps for marketers looking to streamline email creation while maintaining brand consistency across campaigns. Paid advertising (or PPC) demands constant testing and iteration, but thankfully, AI can speed up creative production and optimization. Advertising applications: Pro tip: Establish clear approval workflows before AI-generated ads go live. Review outputs for brand safety, compliance, and accuracy. Add assets that you like or have worked in the past that AI can reference, reducing the need for manual oversight on every asset. Social media managers need consistent, engaging content across multiple platforms. AI helps maintain presence without burnout. Social media AI capabilities include: Pro tip: Maintain your brand voice by providing AI with examples of your best-performing posts. This helps train models to match your tone, style, and values. For deeper insights into what resonates with audiences, check out HubSpot's latest social media trends report. Search engine optimization can be very monotonous and meticulous. AI tools help by handling repetitive SEO tasks so humans can focus elsewhere. Some of the areas it excels include: Pro tip: Don’t slack on quality by neglecting review. AI should enhance your human efforts, not replace them. Editorial teams must verify claims, add original insights, refine brand voice, and ensure content serves user intent rather than just algorithm requirements.

Use HubSpot's AI Search Grader to audit how well your brand shows up in AI-powered search results and answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google's AI Overviews. Marketing leaders drown in data but starve for insights. AI synthesizes performance metrics into actionable recommendations. Analytics AI capabilities: Pro tip: Always validate AI insights against source data. Effective AI analytics tools show their work—citing specific data points and explaining reasoning. Integrate insights with unified reporting in your CRM to close the loop between marketing actions and revenue outcomes. Ideate, create, and share content. Easily create...

For standalone tools, prioritize those with: Here are eight powerful generative AI tools, each solving specific marketing challenges. Every tool includes pricing, key features, best use cases, and integration details. Best for: Marketing teams seeking end-to-end AI automation integrated with their CRM and marketing platform. Breeze is a comprehensive suite of AI-powered tools built directly into the HubSpot platform. Unlike standalone tools requiring integration work, Breeze operates natively within your existing HubSpot workflows, from content creation to customer service. Marketing teams report reducing campaign launch time by 68% after implementation with Breeze. Key HubSpot Breeze AI Features: Agicap saved 750 hours per week and increased deal velocity by 20% using Breeze, while Sandler drove 25% more engagement and 4x sales leads by creating personalized experiences with the platform. When to Use HubSpot Breeze AI: Use Breeze when your team needs AI to understand your business context or that of your customers. Because it enables access to your CRM data, past campaigns, and customer interactions, Breeze can make contextually relevant suggestions rather than generic outputs. HubSpot Breeze AI Integration Fit:  Source Breeze integrates seamlessly with HubSpot‘s Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub, Content Hub, and Operations Hub. It also connects to thousands of third-party apps through HubSpot’s marketplace. The platform works particularly well for teams consolidating their marketing technology stack. HubSpot Breeze AI Pricing: Basic Breeze features (Assistant and select Intelligence capabilities) are available in HubSpot's free CRM. Full Breeze capabilities, including Agents and advanced Intelligence features, require Started, Professional, or Enterprise subscriptions: Advanced AI features consume HubSpot Credits, where each credit equals $0.01 USD. For example, the Customer Agent costs 100 credits per conversation ($1), and the Data Agent costs 10 credits per research prompt ($0.10). Professional plans include monthly credit allotments, with options to purchase additional capacity. Learn more about HubSpot Breeze AI.  Best for: Marketers needing versatile content creation, brainstorming, and conversational AI across all marketing tasks. ChatGPT is the most widely recognized AI tool, known for its versatility in answering questions, generating copy, brainstorming ideas, and handling diverse content formats from emails and blog posts to photos. Key ChatGPT Features: When to Use ChatGPT: Many writers and marketers turn to ChatGPT, praising its ability to produce creative and engaging copy quickly. That said, use it for rapid ideation (i.e., generating topics), drafting initial content (i.e., outlines, blog articles, social media posts), and creative problem-solving. In fact, we do this here on the HubSpot blog. It excels at adapting tone and style based on prompts, making it ideal for teams producing varied content types. ChatGPT Integration Fit: ChatGPT offers API access for custom integrations and connects with thousands of apps through Zapier. The tool works well with most marketing platforms, though it requires manual copying or API development for deeper integrations. HubSpot users can leverage the Claude <> HubSpot connector for similar functionality with even tighter CRM integration. ChatGPT Pricing: Learn more about ChatGPT. Ideate, create, and share content. Easily create...  Best for: Enterprise marketing teams requiring brand-consistent content at scale with advanced collaboration features. It's also ideal for agencies managing multiple client brands. Jasper AI focuses specifically on marketing content creation, offering templates, brand voice management, and team collaboration tools purpose-built for marketing departments. It can also generate graphics, but, in my experience, this feature still has some room for improvement. Key Jasper AI Features: Jasper's brand voice features are particularly valuable for teams struggling with inconsistent messaging. When to Use Jasper AI: Deploy Jasper when brand consistency across content is of the utmost importance (i.e., a multi-channel campaign), as brand voice controls ensure regulatory requirements are met. Jasper AI Integration Fit: Jasper integrates with HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce, and 5,000+ other platforms. The Chrome extension allows content generation within your existing tools, while API access enables custom workflow automation. Jasper AI Pricing: All plans include a 7-day free trial. Learn more about Jasper AI.  Source Best for: Sales and marketing teams needing AI-powered workflows for lead research, outreach, and content distribution. Copy.ai has evolved beyond simple copywriting into a comprehensive Go-to-Market platform with powerful workflow automation capabilities that extend far beyond content creation. Key Copy.ai Features: Copy.ai's Workflow automation is particularly powerful for technical marketing teams who want to automate entire processes rather than just generate individual pieces of content. When to Use Copy.ai: Use Copy.ai when your team includes technically proficient users who are comfortable building custom workflows. If they are, the platform excels at automating repetitive marketing and sales tasks. Copy.ai Integration Fit: Copy.ai offers 7,000+ integrations spanning CRM, project management, analytics, and marketing platforms. The API enables custom implementations, and pre-built workflows connect to major tools like HubSpot, Salesforce, Marketo, and Google Workspace. More flexible than Jasper for custom technical integrations. Copy.ai Pricing: Learn more about Copy.ai.  Source Best for: Social media managers, small business owners, and non-designers creating visual content quickly. Canva has integrated AI throughout its design platform, making professional-quality visual creation accessible to marketers without design backgrounds. Key Canva AI Features: When to Use Canva AI: Canva AI shines in its convenience and ease more so than being groundbreaking. For social media managers creating posts, Canva AI handles everything in one place with platform specs and plenty of templates ready to go. Use it when speed and ease matter more than advanced customization. Canva AI Integration Fit: Canva connects to major social media platforms for direct publishing, integrates with Google Drive and Dropbox for asset management, and offers API access for custom workflows. The platform works well as a standalone tool that doesn't require deep technical integration. Canva AI Pricing: Learn more about Canva AI. Ideate, create, and share content. Easily create...  Source Best for: Marketing teams creating high-quality, artistic visual content for campaigns and brand materials. Midjourney produces the most aesthetically stunning AI-generated images, favored by creative professionals for advertising campaigns, concept art, and premium brand visuals. Key Midjourney Features: When to Use Midjourney: Deploy Midjourney for your most creative campaigns. The generative AI tool nails fantasy landscapes and cinematic scenes but struggles with simple product photography. This makes it ideal for conceptual work, advertisements, and social media content, but not e-commerce product shots or mockups. Midjourney can also get pretty technical, so it’s better to save it when you have a longer timeline. Midjourney Integration Fit: Midjourney operates exclusively through Discord, which means it doesn’t integrate with other tools. Third-party tools can interface with Midjourney, but the lack of official API access that helps data sync effortlessly. It’s best used as a standalone creative tool. Midjourney Pricing: Annual billing provides a 20% discount. Learn more about Midjourney.  Best for: Marketing teams requiring detailed analysis, long-form content, and nuanced writing. Claude, developed by Anthropic, emphasizes safety, accuracy, and thoughtful responses. It excels at complex analytical tasks, technical documentation, and maintaining high standards for factual accuracy. Key Claude Features: When to Use Claude: Use Claude for high-stakes content, technical documentation, and analytical work where accuracy is paramount. It’s also wise to use it for internal products as it’s known for being more secure than other options. Claude Integration Fit: Claude offers API access with competitive pricing and aggressive prompt caching that reduces costs by up to 90% for high-volume usage. The platform integrates well with custom applications and development environments. HubSpot users can access Claude directly through the Claude <> HubSpot connector. Claude Pricing: Learn more about Claude.  Source Best for: Marketers creating product visuals, marketing materials, and images requiring accurate text integration. DALL-E 3, integrated into ChatGPT, excels at creating photorealistic images with proper text rendering—a persistent challenge for most AI image generators. Key DALL-E 3 Features: When to Use DALL-E 3: Use DALL-E 3 for graphic marketing materials, product visualizations, and business presentations. It produces exceptional quality for realistic scenes but creates less artistic, mood-driven imagery than Midjourney. DALL-E 3 Integration Fit: DALL-E 3 API access enables seamless integration into custom applications and automated workflows. Developers can build sophisticated image generation pipelines, while businesses can incorporate AI image creation directly into existing tools. The ChatGPT integration makes it accessible to non-technical users. DALL-E 3 Pricing: Learn more about DALL-E 3. AI tools deliver maximum value when integrated with your existing marketing technology. Standalone tools create silos. With that in mind, ideally your data would flow something like this: Using HubSpot Marketing Hub and Claude as an example, here's how a marketing team would integrate a generative AI tool. Grant AI access to your contact properties, company information, and lifecycle stages. Make sure to configure the permissions so AI sees relevant data without exposing sensitive information. Next, create any essential workflows that trigger AI content generation based on user actions. For example, when a lead downloads a whitepaper, AI can generate a personalized follow-up email based on their industry and company size. By pulling CRM data, generative AI can personalize subject lines, body copy, and even calls to action. With it, each recipient receives messaging relevant to their stage, interests, and behavior. In HubSpot, this can be accomplished using personalization tokens and smart content among other things. AI allows you to automate workflows to publish blog articles, send emails, schedule social posts, and trigger ad campaigns. It can even generate the content is ultimately distributes as we discussed earlier. You can’t know if your marketing is actually working if you don’t measure it. So, track open rates, click-through rates, and conversions for your AI-generated content. Compare performance against manually created content to evaluate ROI and feed winning formulas back into AI prompts for reuse. HubSpot offers a native Claude connector that brings Claude‘s advanced reasoning and writing capabilities directly into your HubSpot workflows. This integration allows marketers to leverage Claude’s superior analytical abilities while maintaining all data within the HubSpot ecosystem. Ideate, create, and share content. Easily create... Consistency requires three elements: documentation, examples, and review processes. Here’s what I recommend: Responsible AI use needs clear policies about data handling, restricted inputs, and tool selection. Do your due diligence by: Most modern AI tools are designed for marketers, not developers. You can start immediately with no-code options, then scale to deeper integrations as needs grow. For instance, web-based AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Jasper, Copy.ai, HubSpot’s Breeze) offer point-and-click interfaces. You simply type prompts, get outputs, and integrate through simple copy-paste or built-in publishing features. No coding required. As you mature, tools like Zapier and Make allow you to connect AI platforms to other apps through visual workflow builders. You can automate processes like “when lead fills form, use AI to generate a follow-up email, send via marketing automation” without writing code. Eventually, you may want custom integrations using API connections. This does require developer resources but unlocks powerful automation. Start small with built-in features. As you prove value, invest in more sophisticated implementations. Measuring AI impact requires establishing baselines, defining clear metrics, and closing the attribution loop. You need to: Define baselines before implementing AI. Ask yourself: Track AI-specific metrics. Some common metrics include: Connect AI outputs to revenue: This is the critical step most teams miss. Use your CRM to track which AI-generated content drives conversions by: HubSpot customers can leverage the platform's unified reporting to connect AI-generated content directly to revenue outcomes. Moreover, according to International Data Corporation, most companies achieve 505% ROI within three years of implementing Marketing Hub. AI adoption speed varies by team size, technical comfort, and implementation approach, but most teams see productivity gains within a few weeks. Here’s an example of what a gradual rollout may look like: Week 1-2: Individual Experimentation Week 3-4: Pilot Projects Month 2: Process Integration Month 3+: Scale and Optimize Want to move faster? Teams that follow structured adoption frameworks typically achieve full productivity within 60-90 days. Marketing departments using HubSpot report a 68% reduction in campaign launch time after integrating AI into their workflows. Listen, generative AI is like a hammer, or any other tool. It doesn’t do the work for you, but it does make the work easier to do. The marketers that win in 2026 won’t be the ones using the most tools; they’ll be the ones using the right tools, connected to their CRM, measured against goals, and overall, reviewed and guided by a human. So, don’t wait. Pick a high-priority use case and pilot a few tools to see how they work. Then expand to other areas as you find those you like. Bottom line: the generative AI tools every marketing team should use are the ones that help you create faster, personalize deeper, and prove impact — without compromising brand, privacy, or data integrity. If you want to see how this works end-to-end, explore HubSpot’s Breeze or connect a model like Claude to your existing HubSpot workflows to keep creation and measurement in one place.

  Building a B2B Loop Marketing strategy represents more than adopting new tactics — it’s about architecting a self-reinforcing system that transforms every customer interaction into compound growth, from initial B2B lead generation through long-term customer expansion.  The challenge? B2B organizations must: That’s where Loop Marketing becomes transformational. Loop Marketing differs from traditional funnels by enabling continuous learning and optimization through four interconnected stages: In this article, you’ll learn how to build your first B2B loop marketing strategy with practical frameworks, real-world examples, and step-by-step implementation guidance for each stage. Let’s jump in. Table of Contents Loop Marketing is a new way to grow — powered by humans and AI, working together to express your message, tailor it to your audience, amplify it across channels, and evolve it in real time. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Loop marketing represents a fundamental shift from the traditional linear sales funnel to a continuous, self-reinforcing cycle that compounds learning and results across: Unlike the one-directional funnel that ends at the sale, loop marketing creates an endless cycle where every customer interaction feeds back into the system, making your entire go-to-market approach more innovative and more effective with each rotation. Think of loop marketing as a growth engine that continually learns and evolves. Where traditional B2B marketing pushed prospects down a funnel from awareness to purchase, loop marketing recognizes that modern B2B buyers no longer follow a straight line. Instead, they’re: Therefore, the loop framework transforms this chaotic reality into a strategic advantage by creating a continuous cycle that: The Loop Marketing Playbook operates through four interconnected stages that create a self-reinforcing growth system:  The “Express” stage, also known as the foundational stage of Loop Marketing, establishes your brand’s distinctive voice and viewpoint before bringing AI into the mix. Key “Express” activities within Loop Marketing include: The “Tailor” stage utilizes unified customer data — encompassing everything from CRM records to call transcripts and website behavior — to craft personalized messages for prospects. Implementation of the “Tailor” stage in Loop Marketing involves: The “Amplify” stage ensures you’re discoverable across channels and recommended by the voices your buyers trust. The strategic priorities of the “Amplify” stage of Loop Marketing include: The Evolve stage turns every campaign into a learning experiment that feeds insights back into the loop. The core components of the “Evolve” stage in Loop Marketing are as follows: Whether we want them to or not, the times have changed. Recent data tells a compelling story about why B2B companies need a new approach. According to HubSpot’s 2025 State of Marketing Report, 47% of B2B marketers admit that consumers who are using AI to answer their questions have entirely impacted web traffic. Additionally, according to GWI’s 2025 Gen Z Report, 31% of Gen Z consumers use AI platforms/chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) to find information on the internet. Moreover, today’s B2B buying committees commonly exhibit these behaviors: Thus, what are the results of these behaviors? Traditional funnels built for linear journeys can’t capture value from these chaotic, multi-directional buying patterns — leaving revenue on the table and competitors to fill the gaps. Loop marketing addresses these realities by meeting buyers wherever they are, not forcing them into predetermined paths. Ready to build your first growth loop? Start free with HubSpot’s Loop Marketing Prompt Library or get a free demo of HubSpot today. The B2B marketing funnel has served us well for decades, but it was built for a different era — one where buyers followed predictable paths and vendors controlled the flow of information. Today’s reality demands a new model. Thus, loop marketing has emerged, transforming the one-way funnel into a continuous cycle that turns every customer interaction into fuel for growth, fundamentally changing how B2B companies approach customer acquisition, retention, and expansion. The classic B2B funnel operates like a factory assembly line with distinct stages:  This linear model assumes buyers move predictably downward, treats each stage as separate, and essentially “ends” at the sale — restarting from scratch with each new prospect. Now, the traditional B2B marketing cycle produces predictable but increasingly insufficient outcomes. While these outcomes are circumstantial, often based on industry complexity, buyer committee size, and market maturity, they present limitations, such as:  As previously mentioned, Loop Marketing works through continuous four-step cycles:  Unlike the funnel’s one-way flow, each loop rotation strengthens the entire system: The critical difference: Unlike a traditional funnel that moves customers down a one-way path, the loop is a continuous cycle that learns and gets sharper every time you use it. Loop Marketing is a new way to grow — powered by humans and AI, working together to express your message, tailor it to your audience, amplify it across channels, and evolve it in real time. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Implementing loop marketing requires specific strategies for each stage of the continuous cycle. While the framework provides structure, success comes from executing practical tactics that transform theory into measurable results. Below are proven strategies for each loop stage, along with step-by-step implementation guidance to help B2B companies build their own self-reinforcing growth engine: Your brand voice must be distinctive enough for humans to recognize and structured enough for AI to replicate. Utilize Breeze and HubSpot Connectors for ChatGPT and Claude to analyze your high-value customers and create a brand style guide that speaks to them. Here’s how you’ll implement this strategic approach for the “Express” stage of Loop Marketing: Pro tip: Create a “voice bank” with 10 to 15 sample responses to common customer questions. This becomes your training data for AI tools and a reference for human writers. Rather than chasing trending topics, establish content pillars that reflect your unique market position and expertise. Here’s a breakdown of how you’ll approach this strategy for the “Express” stage of Loop Marketing: Pro tip: Use HubSpot’s AEO grader to get a better understanding of how AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini interpret your brand.  Move beyond basic demographic personalization to real-time adaptation based on behavioral signals. Here’s how you’ll want to implement this particular strategic approach for the “Tailor” stage of Loop Marketing: Pro tip: Begin with email subject lines and test personalized versions tailored to industry, role, and recent behavior. Use AI to predict and deliver the next best piece of content for each prospect. Here’s how implementing this strategic approach would look in the context of the “Tailor” stage of Loop Marketing: Ensure your content appears in AI-generated responses across ChatGPT, Claude, and other platforms where buyers seek information. Here’s how you can make this happen within the “Amplify” stage of Loop Marketing: Pro tip: Test your content’s AI visibility by asking ChatGPT and Claude questions your buyers would ask. If your content doesn’t appear, revise its structure and clarity until it does. Remix every piece of content into different formats for each stage and channel — an AEO-ready article for ChatGPT, a vertical demo for TikTok, a carousel for LinkedIn. Here’s what you’ll do to maximize content reach within the “Amplify” stage of Loop Marketing: Teams launch campaigns in days instead of months using the Loop Marketing framework through systematic experimentation. Take a look at the tips outlined below to implement this strategic approach within the “Evolve” stage of Loop Marketing: Simulate campaign outcomes prior to launch using predictive AI tools to optimize before spending the budget. Here’s what you’ll want to do to successfully do this within the “Evolve” stage of Loop Marketing: Although the formal Loop Marketing framework is relatively new, several B2B companies have been implementing loop-like strategies that demonstrate the power of continuous, self-reinforcing growth systems. It’s also important to note: HubSpot’s Loop Marketing Playbook is already driving measurable results for B2B companies — Kelly Services achieved a 32% increase in site users and 26% increase in sessions through loop implementation. Additionally, Morehouse College optimized 900+ pages with Breeze Studio and a loop marketing approach while maintaining an authentic brand voice. These organizations connect customer insights to content creation, personalize at scale, amplify across multiple channels, and continuously evolve based on performance data, creating compound value with each cycle. Next, let’s take a look at some B2B-specific examples of loop marketing in action:  Source Klarna transformed from a Swedish payment provider into a global commerce enabler by creating sophisticated loops between consumer shopping behavior, merchant success data, and B2B product development. Here’s how they did it with Loop Marketing as their B2B secret weapon:  Source Drift transformed B2B buying by creating continuous feedback loops between website visitors, sales conversations, and content optimization, enabling more informed decisions. Check out the breakdown below to get a better look at how they’ve implemented Loop Marketing into their B2B approach:  Source Gong built their entire growth engine on continuous loops between sales call recordings, content marketing, and product positioning. Here’s a brief overview of how Gong integrates Loop Marketing into their B2B strategy:  Source While known as a design platform, Canva’s B2B division demonstrates sophisticated Loop Marketing by connecting user behavior, template creation, and enterprise adoption. Here’s a closer look at how they adopt Loop Marketing (without even telling their customers) to make B2B marketing easier: Begin with a minimal viable loop, focusing on your highest-converting customer segment and two proven channels where that segment actively engages — typically LinkedIn for professional content and email for direct nurturing. Then, structure your week with this cadence: This focused approach generates compound learning without overwhelming resources; each week’s insights directly improve the performance of the following week. However, scale only after achieving consistent results: when your two-channel loop generates a predictable pipeline, add a third channel; when personalization lifts engagement by 20%, expand to a second segment. Pro tip: Breeze accelerates the Loop Marketing foundation by automating content variations, analyzing performance patterns, and suggesting optimization opportunities. Start personalization with the data you trust most — typically job title, company size, and industry from your CRM — before attempting behavioral or intent-based customization. Then, implement a graduated enrichment approach: This progression ensures message relevance while building data confidence. You’re personalizing with accurate information rather than risking irrelevance with questionable data. Once you’ve done this, focus initial personalization on high-impact elements that don’t require perfect data, such as: Pro tip: Breeze’s data enrichment capabilities can fill critical gaps by scanning public sources to verify and expand contact records, while always prioritizing message relevance over personalization complexity. A perfectly targeted message, utilizing three accurate data points, outperforms a heavily personalized message built on unreliable information. Add creator partnerships when three signals align: Next, structure creator partnerships using this ICP-tied framework: Pro tip: Before reaching out, use Breeze to analyze which creators your best customers follow, what content themes generate their highest engagement, and where your perspectives complement rather than compete with theirs. This intelligence transforms cold outreach into strategic alignment conversations. Implement this AEO quick-wins checklist for immediate AI visibility: Apply these optimizations first to your highest-traffic pillar pages and product documentation. These foundational pieces compound in value as AI systems continually reference them. The shift from funnel to loop marketing isn’t just a tactical upgrade — it’s a fundamental reimagining of how B2B growth compounds over time. Where funnels create linear journeys that end at purchase and restart with each prospect, loops build self-reinforcing systems where every interaction strengthens the whole. Loop Marketing’s four-stage framework — Express, Tailor, Amplify, and Evolve — transforms marketing from a cost center that burns through budget to a compound asset that appreciates with use. Every customer interaction feeds insights that improve acquisition; every piece of content becomes smarter through performance data; every experiment accelerates learning that benefits all future campaigns. This isn’t theoretical — it’s happening now, with early adopters pulling further ahead while traditional marketers debate whether AI will matter. Unlike point solutions that perpetuate silos, HubSpot and Breeze create a continuous data flow and AI-powered automation that makes loops possible for teams of any size. Start your Loop Marketing transformation by identifying your most significant growth constraint — whether it’s differentiation (Express), relevance (Tailor), reach (Amplify), or learning speed (Evolve) — and implement your first loop strategy there. Ready to enter your Loop Marketing era? Access the complete Loop Marketing Playbook and see how Breeze AI can accelerate your journey from linear funnels to compound growth loops.

  Healthcare businesses vary in scope, from wellness centers to doctors' offices to hospitals. But they share one important need: They all must safeguard any protected health information (PHI) they possess, especially when doing email marketing.  Email marketing tools for healthcare help keep patients informed of promotions, upcoming appointments, and ways to stay healthy. But not all are created equal. How do you balance feature richness with HIPAA compliance needs? This article will help you choose the best email marketing software for your healthcare business, complete with a comparison table, feature breakdowns, a how-to guide, and FAQs. We used AI for research and drafting, and a HubSpot staff writer reviewed and revised this article before publication. The stakes are high — three-quarters of patients want more personalized healthcare experiences, according to a Redpoint Global survey. Email marketing software that connects with a CRM delivers exactly that, helping healthcare organizations personalize their marketing to build stronger patient connections. For example, medical simulation company VirtaMed improved email interaction rates significantly by centralizing lead nurturing with HubSpot Marketing Hub, showing how the right platform drives measurable results for healthcare businesses. Table of Contents Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for healthcare enables medical practices, hospitals, clinics, and wellness centers to communicate with patients through targeted email campaigns. Healthcare email marketing software helps organizations send appointment reminders, share health education content, promote wellness programs, and maintain patient engagement while adhering to strict privacy requirements.

Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Automated email reminders help ensure that your patients never forget an appointment, while saving your team time. Segmentation helps you group recipients based on their interests. Additionally, an email marketing tool that connects to a CRM, like HubSpot’s all-in-one platform, ensures that you can personalize your emails with patient preferences. Email marketing can create trust and rapport with patients, providing them with helpful tips, reminders, and relationship-building content. The right email marketing tool not only boosts ROI — it helps you prove it. For example, HubSpot Marketing Hub has an analytics dashboard that helps you connect email marketing campaigns with revenue outcomes. HubSpot enables tracking opens, clicks, conversions, and revenue attribution on the same platform, eliminating disjointed systems. Talk to your marketing team and evaluate your existing marketing software. What is the current process for sending email marketing messages? What does your marketing team wish they could do? What problems are they running into? An audit will unearth the unique needs that’ll shape your must-have features, which we’ll identify in our next step. As we went over in the section above, security features that help you meet HIPAA requirements are a must-have for healthcare companies. But your specific business might have additional needs. If your team is on the go a lot, for example, a mobile-friendly email marketing tool might be top of mind. Search Google, read reviews, and talk to fellow healthcare marketers to find recommended email marketing tools. You’ll also need to review each vendor’s product pages and documentation to make sure their solutions can actually meet the needs you identified in step two. Once you have your shortlist of tools for email marketing for healthcare, it’s time to put them to the test. Sign up for free trials or demos to get a better feel for how the tools work and if they meet your needs. A major pain point for many marketers is having disconnected tools that fail to give them a 360-degree view of their customers. HubSpot is an all-in-one platform that connects email marketing to its Smart CRM so you can spot trends, connect campaigns to results, and power your campaigns with customer insights. MedicAlert replaced its disconnected systems with HubSpot's all-in-one platform to successfully track KPIs across marketing, finance, sales, and service. Creating effective email marketing campaigns for healthcare requires you to balance patient engagement with regulatory compliance. Below are some suggested steps to take. Establish clear objectives for your healthcare email campaigns before launching. Healthcare organizations use email marketing to achieve multiple goals, including reducing no-shows, educating patients, and making service announcements. HubSpot helps healthcare teams set campaign goals and track performance against marketing outcomes. Healthcare email marketing must meet regulatory requirements to protect patient information. Three key considerations guide healthcare email campaigns: HubSpot's Marketing Hub can be configured to support compliant email workflows when used appropriately by healthcare organizations. Segment your email list into targeted groups that align with campaign objectives. Ensure each segment includes only contacts who opted into that specific communication category — for example, contacts in a healthy eating tips segment must have explicitly consented to receive that content. Develop personalized email content that addresses each segment‘s specific needs and interests. Healthcare email content performs best when it provides value through patient education, wellness tips, or timely service information. HubSpot’s Marketing Hub offers personalization tokens and dynamic content that allow healthcare marketers to customize messages. Configure your email marketing platform with proper safeguards and compliance considerations in place. Healthcare organizations should work with their legal and compliance teams to establish appropriate processes. Track key performance metrics to evaluate campaign effectiveness and patient engagement. Healthcare email marketers monitor open rates, click-through rates, appointment bookings, and unsubscribe rates to understand campaign performance. HubSpot's reporting dashboard shows email performance metrics that help healthcare teams assess campaigns against their goals. Continuously improve email campaigns based on performance data and patient feedback. Regularly test subject lines, content formats, and send times to optimize engagement rates. HubSpot's A/B testing tools allow healthcare marketers to test different email variations to identify what resonates with patients. The best email marketing tool for healthcare depends on your organization's specific needs and size. HubSpot Marketing Hub is the top choice for growth-focused healthcare businesses that need an all-in-one platform with features that support HIPAA compliance, advanced marketing automation, and a unified customer platform. For organizations specifically prioritizing HIPAA compliance features, Paubox Marketing offers a purpose-built solution and includes a BAA with all of its accounts. Small practices, especially in dental and optometry, may prefer Weave's patient communication platform that includes email marketing alongside scheduling and billing. When evaluating email marketing tools for healthcare, look for features that support HIPAA compliance, including a Business Associate Agreement (BAA), data encryption in transit and at rest, and audit logs. Additionally, prioritize marketing automation capabilities for appointment reminders and patient nurture campaigns, integrations with your existing healthcare software like EHR/EMR systems, and robust measurement tools that show how your campaigns perform and contribute to your bottom line. A visual workflow builder makes it easier for marketing teams to create automated campaigns without coding knowledge. HubSpot is a good option for companies looking for email marketing tools for healthcare professionals. As of October 2024, you can enable the Sensitive Data functionality in your Enterprise account and use the tool in a HIPAA-compliant way. HubSpot stands out because its email marketing is built into its Smart CRM, enabling healthcare organizations to personalize patient communications using CRM data while tracking email performance alongside revenue outcomes. Healthcare companies like Santagostino and MedicAlert have successfully used HubSpot Marketing Hub to grow their patient base and improve marketing effectiveness. Email marketing software for healthcare varies widely in cost depending on features and contact list size. Paubox Marketing is free for up to 100 contacts. Paid plans for email marketing software for healthcare typically start between $4-$259 per month (billed monthly) for small contact lists. Weave starts at $249/month for its all-in-one patient communication platform. Most healthcare email marketing tools are priced based on contact count or feature tier. HubSpot’s CRM is free, but its Sensitive Data functionality is available only on Enterprise plans, so a business seeking to achieve HIPAA compliance will need an Enterprise plan. Marketing Hub is built on the all-in-one HubSpot customer platform, so you can connect your email marketing, sales, and operations, plus power your marketing efforts with your CRM data. Healthcare company Santagostino grew its customer base over 9x larger using HubSpot Marketing Hub. Childcare marketplace Winnie used HubSpot Marketing Hub to optimize its email program, increasing active suppliers by 32% in the first month.

  Sam Meller is the Head of Social for The Hustle, but we briefly got to borrow her for Masters in Marketing, because she makes everything she touches better. That’s how I got a chance to hear about a tactical content shift that led to a startling 35,000% increase in visibility on LinkedIn. When I heard this story, y’all, I threw an Asana card on our editorial calendar so fast I nearly broke my clickin’ finger.  In short, it’s the cautionary tale of how even good content may not be the right content for your audience. And how, even in this data-soaked paradigm, sometimes you still need good ol’ human instinct.  When Sam first stepped into her role at The Hustle, she started with an audit of all its various social media channels. “I wanted to really get a sense of what was working, what wasn’t working, and where we had opportunities to grow.” She quickly noticed a disconnect: The Hustle was killing it on Instagram, but on LinkedIn? They weren’t feeling the love. At the time, both channels were using the same content strategy: Daily recap videos where the host of The Hustle Daily Show would do a rundown of the headlines of the day. But while these videos were popular on Instagram, they just didn’t seem to land with The Hustle’s LinkedIn audience. This is where a lot of marketers would simply assume that LinkedIn just wasn’t the right channel for their brand. But with over a decade in content marketing, Sam has learned to trust her gut. “LinkedIn should be a really strong platform for us,” she explained. “Given that our whole brand is about business, careers, and entrepreneurship technology, it’s a natural fit. But we weren’t really getting any traction.” Around this time, Sam noticed that LinkedIn had launched a (then new) short-form video feature, similar to Instagram Reels. “I’m just exploring [on LinkedIn] and starting to see a lot of these vertical videos of podcasts or explainer videos, and I think, ‘We have that! Let’s try that out!’” But making unique, tailored content for each channel would simply take too much bandwidth and budget. “I had the idea to test out podcast clips from My First Million with Sam Parr, who was the founder of The Hustle.” And, while sharing the same name didn’t hurt (Sam-ple bias? Wakka wakka), her thought process was more about aligning topically-relevant content to the expectations of the platform. The results were nearly immediate. “[Before the test] we had 71,000 total impressions in the month of August, and in September we had to the tune of 25 million impressions just from LinkedIn alone.”  Now, featuring a well-known media figure certainly played a part, but before you dismiss this as simply face recognition, consider that The Hustle found similar success with less recognizable hosts. Following this test, Sam (Meller, not Parr) reached out to the podcast and YouTube teams to gather their most successful content to turn into clips that matched this audience’s vibe. The numbers didn’t drop. “One of them got over a million views alone, compared to the 400 we were getting prior.” Here’s what Sam says you should take away: Which stands to reason, right? How often do you like a company so much that you’ll follow them on Instagram and LinkedIn? And, even if you did, would you want to watch the same video twice? Sam attributes a large part of the success to showing off the people behind the content. “It’s really important to us that we’re showing our talent, our people, because I strongly believe that people want to follow people. They don’t want to follow a brand. They want to see personality.” And this starts as early as your thumbnails. “In pretty much all cases, the best performing videos start off with someone’s face. Even if it’s for two seconds, you see a person, and they hook you.” “I still need a little more data before I say that’s 100% the reason. But I’ve been doing this for long enough that my spidey senses are tingling.” If Sam had blindly followed the data, she might have de-prioritized LinkedIn or abandoned it completely. And The Hustle would have lost out on millions of views and untold brand equity. “I respect the data. I use the data. I think it’s a fantastic tool, but I will be the first person to tell you that I do not live and die by the data.” Instead, think of your data as a guidepost instead of the end-all-be-all of your strategy. When asked for the moral of the story, Sam sums it up: “It’s really important that you’re trusting yourself and trying out new things. Not thinking ‘Oh, this worked for us six months ago.’ The internet moves too fast to stay in one lane.”  Exclusive interviews with industry leaders, and curated resources, to help you become a better marketer.

  There has never been a bigger moment in history when brand differentiation was more important. The channels we relied on for growth are saturated and increasingly less effective. And with AI changing how people search and make buying decisions, the race to stand out has never been more brutal.  The brands at the top of the food chain are those we associate with a specific problem. For example, if I want running shoes, I go to Hoka. For skincare, I’m a Byoma girlie, and if I’m craving apple juice, Innocent cures my thirst. But how do these brands differentiate in a crowded market space? What makes them so memorable? In this article, I’ll share my favorite examples of companies smashing brand differentiation and give you actionable tips on how to stand out from the crowd. Table of Contents Brand differentiation is how you carve out mental real estate in a market where everyone‘s screaming for attention. It’s not just your logo, your tagline, or your mission statement. It's the specific reason someone chooses you over a competitor when both products could technically solve their problem. A comprehensive guide to effectively define, launch, scale, and monitor your brand. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Differentiator: Product-led growth that turns customers into advocates In a previous Moz Whiteboard Friday, I said the most important way to build brand authority is to have a great product. There’s no workaround for this. A great product keeps people in-app and coming back. That’s why I love Revolut.  When I moved to the UK in 2022 and needed a banking solution, all my friends pointed me to the app. Revolut offered multicurrency accounts backed by frictionless banking, and I’d never seen anything like it. It feels like an everyday app that combines banking, investment, and features you’d only get on a typical credit card.  A great product feels two steps ahead of you. It anticipates your needs, offers features before you ask, and gets you from A to Z with ease. Here’s how Revolut differentiates from other neobanks: No amount of advertising or marketing spend can save a bad product. Invest in your core experience. Build features that meet the standard, and go further with future-forward innovation that keeps people in the app. Differentiator: A unique blend of education, design, and storytelling I first heard about Better Trail’s content in the TOFU community when David Broderick used them as an example of intuitive content. So, I took a look, and I was thoroughly impressed. Google is starting to surface longer answers through AI Overviews and AI Mode, cannibalizing traffic that would usually go to websites. Better Trail, a review site that depends on traffic and commissions for survival, is doing something different to attract and keep users. Here’s how Better Trail differentiates from other review sites: The UX is amazing, and I love how it makes the content look more like a magazine than a blog post. If you want to quickly scan the recommendations, they've got you with skim.  Source Need a little bit more detail? Choose medium. And if you have time to read the entire thing, they've got a 14,000-word banger for you. Better Trail skips all the unnecessary SEO optimization of “what is” and “how to.” The site instead goes straight to an overview of hiking shoe superlatives, so you can quickly make a choice.  Source When buying a hiking shoe, you look for specific features, like comfort, foot protection, and durability. Better Trail uses a scoring system to rate each feature, making it easy to choose based on what's important to you.  Source Basically, they've provided the information people look for when buying a product and removed barriers that prevent a sale, all in one go. You’re not going to capture and hold attention if your content looks like everyone else’s. You need a format that feels fresh and unique. Anticipate the decisions people are trying to make and give them answers before they even know what to ask. Finally, structure your content so it works for scanners, researchers, and power users alike. Differentiator: Turning internal SMEs into multi-channel influencers Revenue Intelligence is a heavily saturated niche with many competitors providing similar feature sets. Gong sits within that niche as one of the most expensive options. So, the brand differentiates and captures market share by prioritizing relationships and human-led conversations, not just pricing or features.  Source I haven’t seen another brand lean into LinkedIn the way Gong has with its internal SMEs. The first time I heard about Gong was through Udi Ledergor’s LinkedIn content. He was so engaging that I had to check out his profile. Since then, I’ve seen other internal SMEs, like Brian LaManna (104k), JC Pollard (48k), and others post thoughtful, relevant content. Their target audience (sales leaders) spends a lot of time on LinkedIn, so it makes sense for Gong’s AEs and marketing leaders to build a presence there.  Source They also show up through activation events like the Celebrate Conference, which platforms Gong’s leadership team alongside external experts.  Source In addition, there are ongoing webinars. These digital gatherings are usually co-hosted by one Gong SME and a known industry voice. The brand also hosts smaller in-person events that create space to interact with its audience. It’s brilliant, really. People trust people, and Gong empowers their internal experts to build thought leadership and stay top of mind. Identify experts within your company who want to grow their personal profiles and leverage them to strengthen the overall brand image. Allow them to speak in their own voice, and don’t try to censor their content. Create a program that helps them spread their influence externally through podcasts, webinars, and even public speaking. If they show up in the places your audience is already hanging out, that’s a win for your brand. A comprehensive guide to effectively define, launch, scale, and monitor your brand.

Differentiator: Inclusive products and campaigns that ensure holistic representation Before Fenty, beauty brands got away with exclusion for decades. Deeper foundation shades were an afterthought and rarely existed. Even worse, the people creating products for BIPOC women weren’t part of our communities, and it showed in the existing range. Rihanna saw the gap and built Fenty to close it.  Source She launched Fenty Beauty in 2017 with 40 foundation shades on day one because she knew what it felt like not to find your shade of makeup in the store. Personally, I was excited! She was a disruptor, making inclusive products that customers had been begging for, but no one had created. And suddenly, brands that had never prioritized inclusivity scrambled to expand their shade ranges.  Source It’s a smart move because Fenty wasn’t trying to compete with the big names. They focused on creating products for BIPOC women with shades you couldn’t find elsewhere, which allowed them to carve a niche for themselves. Within 40 days of launching, Fenty had $100,000,000 in revenue, proof that there is a market for diverse beauty products. But, it’s not just inclusive shades. Fenty has consistently featured plus-size models, disabled models, and talent from across the gender spectrum.  Source Everyone gets to see themselves in Fenty because the brand is intentional about representation. It also helps that Rihanna uses her personal brand to maximize visibility for Fenty. She makes tutorials showing people how to use the products, which builds a sense of ownership and community around every launch.  Source However, this only worked because the product is fantastic. Fenty also gives back through the Clara Lionel Foundation to fund climate resilience, health initiatives, and education for marginalized communities. You can’t just add a value or mission statement to your website and call it an inclusive brand. You need to start at the product level and ensure that your target audience is represented in the internal teams. Representation and trust go hand in hand. When done right, they build a movement that turns customers into brand evangelists. Differentiator: A tool that’s seamlessly embedded in everyday workflows There’s a YouTube video from 2018 where Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, talks about what makes a great product. He says, “If a product is so good that people spontaneously tell their friends about it, you’ve already done 80% of the work.” Friends, I’ve been on the train, in the air, and on the beach, and at each of these locations, someone was talking about ChatGPT. There’s a pattern I’m seeing as I write this article, where the best brand differentiators are disruptors that innovate with a product so good, it turns the industry on its head. OpenAI has done that with every product they’ve launched, including: Specifically, ChatGPT has become an everyday app. For example, I use it to find healthy recipes, troubleshoot issues with my washing machine, automate content workflows, and even help with fundraising for my nonprofit, The FCDC.  OpenAI recently released ChatGPT Pulse. Pulse will deliver personalized updates based on the user’s behavior. In my opinion, this new feature increases app usage and further embeds ChatGPT as part of people’s daily routine.  Source Brands that differentiate are those whose products become habits. Habit is how you rank in the user’s mind before they start a search. You want to be the first name out of their mouth when a friend asks for a recommendation. The most powerful form of differentiation is when your users do the marketing for you. Focus on building a product so good, people evangelize without incentive. Differentiator: Punk rock branding for canned water Water is essential to life. It’s something we’re all told to drink more of, yet not everyone enjoys it. A poll by CivicScience revealed that nearly half of U.S. adults consume far below the recommended amount of eight glasses per day.  Source The core problem is that many people don’t see water as something they want but as a routine they’re supposed to do. Liquid Death set out to break the mold when they launched in 2019. In a U.S. market flooded with nearly 3,000 bottled water brands, the brand found white space by making water fun. Every time I hear the word “liquid death,” I imagine myself swinging a solid-body electric guitar and playing with Brian May. That’s the brand image that Liquid Death has built. Instead of clean, serene packaging, they gave us tallboys with flaming skulls and taglines like “Murder your thirst.”  Source Their content is ridiculous, in the best way. They’ve dropped a metal album about hydration, launched a kids' cartoon called “Murderverse,” and even paid people to get Liquid Death tattoos.  Source And, it works. Liquid Death now has over 14 million followers on Instagram and TikTok. In 2024, they pulled in over $333 million in retail sales, up 26% from $263 million the year before. While most CPG brands are still trying to figure out how to connect with Gen Z and Millennials, Liquid Death has already built a cult following. The brand shows that an anti-corporate tone can work. One reason people don't connect with branded content is because it's not engaging. Often, interactions feel faceless and boring. Make your brand fun. Liquid Death’s content works because it’s true to their brand and carries over into their product, marketing, and brand identity. Even water can become a habit when it’s marketed in an engaging way. A comprehensive guide to effectively define, launch, scale, and monitor your brand. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. These steps are based on principles from “The Difference Engine”. This is a model of differentiation best practices founded by HubSpot Diamond Solutions partner, Articulate Marketing. To start, let’s view the eight steps from a high level. Then, we’ll dive into the details, along with examples you can use to inspire your own efforts. Google’s mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. This Google example showcases a few key elements to help you define your mission: Your mission should be a central goal. From here, you can position your products and services, build out yearly goals, quarterly objectives and metrics for success, and develop your strategies. This is the first step. You’ll want to use this structure to define your ambitions. Once you’ve identified your mission, everyone in your business will be singing from the same song sheet. Your collective voice will carry. Stations play your tune on the radio, the album goes platinum, you become the next Adele of … HealthTech. It’s all within reach if you make it your mission to get there. There are two sides to any brand. The first is the brand identity as it relates to customers. The second is how your brand is positioned within your community, as an employer, and as a global citizen. In other words, the culture of your company. Too many organizations pay lip service to culture. They offer basic benefits and post a “values” chart on the wall. It’s not enough. Talented employees will go elsewhere. But employees that enjoy a great company culture are 3.8 times more likely to be engaged. And engaged and talented people make for an exceptional business. In fact, clients are starting to pay attention to workplace culture, too, because they want to work with happy, supported, and empowered teams — while also having business partners who are committed to shared values. It’s no longer just about cost and results, but about the types of companies people want to partner with for the long-term. Recommendation: Consider third-party certifications, as provided by the likes of Investors in People and B Corp. Their evaluations leave nowhere to hide, so they keep you honest. Such certifications are the evidence that you really do business differently. The best businesses use the best tools. Take Ecologi’s story as an example. Ecologi has established a fantastic brand differentiation strategy. They offer unparalleled transparency around carbon offsetting and tree planting with technology that showcases the great work they do. Their climate-positive mission is timely and well-targeted. What they offer is in-demand given the current environmental crisis. So they began experiencing rapid growth. Businesses want to do their part to achieve net zero. Ecologi provides the means to get there. Although they had experienced success with HubSpot Sales Hub, they relied on multiple systems for marketing. This meant valuable data was falling through the cracks. They had limited marketing intelligence and patchy lead capture compliance. Any changes relied on dev support. Once they were successfully brought onto HubSpot’s Marketing Hub, however, their team found they could track lead sources as well as align their marketing and sales processes. By making the most of the tools, they saw accelerated results. Now, they can personalize campaigns to target sectors, extend their reach, and grow their reputation as a brand. That example is just one way that tools empower a brand to stand head-and-shoulders above the rest. So, step three: audit your toolkit. You want to have a strategic blueprint for all elements of your content and communications. These are the core guides for your positioning. A strategic blueprint is an up-to-date document that everyone in your organization can access. It’s up to you what you need a blueprint for. Most businesses will have these: Consistency is integral to differentiation. If you have a consistent brand, then it’s going to be easier to recognize, whether your audience is reading a Tweet or watching a video. These strategic blueprints should be applied with such regularity and enthusiasm that an outsider could guess their contents. Let’s put that idea into practice. Try this exercise. Take one of these strong brands that you’re familiar with and sketch out a persona and the journey they go on to buy, three key messages, five attitude words and a couple of notable styles, such as the use of formal/informal words: Once you’ve done that, try to do the same for your business. Step five is all about establishing your visual brand. This is a huge topic, but let’s ask ourselves some key questions. When did you last update your logo? Is it simple, modern, and legible? Do you have a well-defined visual style throughout your website and other channels? Are things like your fonts and color palette defined in a brand book? Has your website been updated in the last couple of years? Does it accurately reflect your services and your story? Is it fast loading and easy to navigate? Like with strategic blueprints, consistency is vital. If you have a consistent visual brand, then it’s more likely to become familiar with your audience. Therefore, they will remember who you are.  Source Beyond Encryption, a secure communications provider, took their visual branding a step further than most companies. Rather than having one logo and one colorway, they chose to develop a whole brand family. Each of their product lines has its own logo and design profile; they are harmonious, yet distinct. They all flow from the same brand methodology, with the main site brand and logo as the “parent.” Beyond Encryption uses this brand family to target segmented audiences while maintaining a clear, differentiated brand. Thought leadership is a tactic content marketers use to build credibility for themselves or leaders in their company. Essentially, thought leadership is brand positioning based on expertise. The good thing about expertise is, unlike positioning based on price, it’s something you can leverage in a unique and thought-provoking way. It’s the route to long-term positioning that you build over time, rather than a quick and dirty race to the bottom. Real experts have knowledge and opinions that other people are interested in learning about. Businesses with in-house experts can differentiate themselves by creating thought leadership content, like blogs and white papers, leveraging their expertise. This helps you establish credibility with your audience. What we don’t suggest, however, is positioning based on the concept of expertise (“I’m an expert, so trust me”). Thought leaders demonstrate their expertise in tangible ways. They have certifications, and are evidence-based. They don’t just say they are experts. They show it. The other mistake people sometimes make is to confuse expertise with complexity. This means filling your content with obscure jargon about your services. That’s not going to work, either. As Einstein put it, “If you can‘t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” Once you’ve got your thought leadership content out into the world, you can expect to see a growing audience coming to your website. From there, you want to capture contact details, such as people’s names and email addresses. Here is another opportunity to differentiate yourself. The lead generation and nurturing process is where you start to see real engagement with your brand. It’s your chance to build a relationship with prospects. So many businesses drop the ball here. They miss opportunities to get leads. Or they dive right into pushy sales tactics once they do get them. Here’s an alternative approach: Lastly, let’s talk optimization. Sir David Brailsford leads Britain’s first ever professional cycling team. At the 2008 Olympics, his team won the majority of gold medals in track cycling and did the same at the next Olympics. Sir David Brailsford told Harvard Business Review, “It struck me that we should think small, not big, and adopt a philosophy of continuous improvement through the aggregation of marginal gains. Forget about perfection; focus on progression, and compound the improvements.” You don’t necessarily need to shake up your whole brand to differentiate your business. You can simply make small improvements that, over time, make a big difference. In marketing, this means observing what works, tracking and measuring the data, testing variants, and implementing the better option, every time. That’s how you go for gold. These eight steps to brand differentiation are definitely not for the risk averse. But they are for ambitious companies and leaders who have a growth mindset. The difference between you and every other business out there is that you’re willing to take the first step. You have to bake your differentiating element into your brand from day one. It can’t be an afterthought. The brands winning today built products that form habits, tell stories worth sharing, and live their mission like a second skin.

  I’m going to say something that might ruffle a few feathers, but here it is: I’m still disappointed by most welcome emails I receive. Not because I expect every brand to knock it out of the park, but because this moment, this exact moment, is such a rare opportunity.  A person was interested enough to raise their hand and say, “Yes, I want to hear from you.” And instead of leaning into that curiosity, most marketers squander it with a bland “Thanks for signing up” and a promise of more emails sometime in the future.  That moment right after sign-up? That’s the subscriber honeymoon period. It’s short, it’s powerful, and it’s when your new subscriber is paying attention. They’re curious. They’re open. They’re literally waiting to see what you’ll say next. And your welcome message, your first impression, can either reward that attention or quietly shut the door on it. The same idea applies when welcoming a new employee. They’ve said “yes” to your organization, likely after weeks (or months) of interviews, decisions, and excitement. That first onboarding message isn’t just logistics. It’s emotional real estate. It’s your opportunity to affirm their choice, ease their nerves, and set the tone for what working with you will feel like. Whether you’re writing to a new subscriber or a new team member, the welcome email is more than a formality. It’s a moment. And you only get one shot at it.

It confirms their subscription, sets expectations, and gives them a quick intro to your brand’s vibe and value. It’s not just polite; it’s prime real estate for making a strong first impression and setting the stage for engagement. Pro tip: Use HubSpot’s free email marketing software to easily create a high-quality welcome email sequence like the ones featured below.  If you’ve ever clicked unsubscribe after a bland “Thanks for joining” message, you already know the pain of a wasted welcome email. Your first message should do more than wave hello; it should prove your value. Start with the feature (what they get), follow with the benefit (why it matters), and end with the advantage (why it’s better than other options). This structure isn’t just tidy, it’s persuasive. The goal? Make subscribers feel like they’ve just made a smart decision by joining your list. Because they did. Pro tip: Use real user language from surveys or reviews when describing the benefit. It keeps things grounded and customer-centered — plus, it’s more likely to resonate. No one wants to feel like they just got an automated shrug from a robot. Your welcome email should sound like you: warm, real, and human. Even if your brand skews corporate, this is the time to relax your tie and let your personality peek through. A touch of humor? Yes. A short anecdote or “here’s what drives us”? Even better. The tone should feel like your best salesperson just slid into the inbox with a smile, not a pitch. Pro tip: Read it out loud before sending. If it sounds like something you’d never say in real life, rewrite it. The inbox has zero tolerance for blandness. This is where you get ahead of the “Wait, why am I getting this?” moment. Be explicit: How often will they receive email from you? What kind of content will you send them? When can they expect the next one? Setting expectations upfront builds trust and reduces unsubscribes, not to mention that it saves you from the wrath of subscribers who feel spammed after two perfectly normal messages. The more transparent you are, the more control the reader feels they have. That’s a good thing. Pro tip: Use a short bulleted list or a bolded section header like “Here’s what to expect” so even scanners catch it. If your welcome email doesn’t include a clear next step, you’re leaving engagement on the table. Whether it’s reading a blog post, filling out a preference center, or grabbing a freebie, every welcome email should include a single, strong call-to-action (CTA). Make it prominent, persuasive, and — here’s the kicker — bulletproof. Meaning: Don’t rely on images. Use HTML-styled buttons that still display if images are blocked (which, by the way, they often are). Pro tip: Treat your CTA like a headline. Make it benefit-driven (“Get your first wellness tip”) instead of directive (“Click here”). Your subscribers are reading emails on phones, tablets, and desktops. That welcome email has to look good everywhere. Use fluid layouts, mobile-first coding practices, and test your design on multiple screen sizes. At the very least, make sure fonts are legible and buttons are tappable. Because nothing kills a first impression like a pinched-zoom scroll-fest. Pro tip: Run your email through a mobile preview tool or test in multiple email clients before sending. What looks great in Gmail might look broken in Outlook (sigh). So, what does a great welcome email look like? I’ve collected some standout welcome message examples that include confirmation messages, thank you emails, and offer templates to help you with your customer onboarding process from start to finish — and make a great impression along the way.  While many subscribers click submit to solve a problem, positivity is key in a welcome email. This org supports women on their path to wage equality. It could be tempting for this email to start with emotionally charged language or statistics that show how big a problem the gender pay gap is. Instead, PepTalkHer shows its understanding of its target audience. This email centers on the support, value, and overall awesomeness of the community. It also adds useful links to social media and website channels. This helps jump-start each signup’s journey. What I like: I think it’s amazing that this email’s priority is placed on the benefits it brings to the reader. This creates a sense of belonging and encourages long-term engagement.  There’s nothing quite like a personal welcome email to make an impression on new subscribers. I believe that good writing is good thinking, and this welcome email is a great example of that idea. This message reads authentic, kind, and curious. It uses direct language, easy-to-read paragraphs, and simple CTAs. This shows every subscriber what they’re getting into with their subscription and leaves them excited for more. What I like: This email is more of a personal letter from the founder and less of a welcome email. That’s what makes it stand out and appealing to the reader.  I think powerful graphics are a great way to make a strong first impression. After signing up for skincare brand Oui the People’s mailing list, the welcome email that hits your inbox makes a gorgeous visual statement that shows the brand’s vision and personality. Then, it uses bold type to make a compelling offer. The copy that follows not only matches but amplifies the vibe of the opening image. “Together, we’re going against the grain of traditional beauty to create (damned good) products that feel like they were designed just for you and all of your glorious complexity. Life-changing, not you-changing.” The one-two punch of graphics, CTA, and copy makes this welcome email difficult not to engage with. What I like: I love how the powerful and poetic copy perfectly complements the email’s visuals, reinforcing the brand’s unique vision and values.

From the subject line down to the conversational tone in the email body, the welcome email above keeps it friendly and simple, so the focus stays on the introductory video inside. Monday.com is a task management tool for teams and businesses. The welcome email you receive when you sign up makes you feel like a CEO because Roy Man is speaking directly to you. What I like: I love how the email even personalizes the opening greeting by using the recipient’s first name, which is well known for increasing email click-through rates (especially if the name is in the subject line). In my experience, the more you can make your email sound like a one-on-one conversation between you and your subscriber, the better. If you have just so many details that you need to inform your new customer about, follow Monday.com’s lead and embed a video rather than spelling them all out in the email itself.  Let’s face it: The internet-using public is constantly bombarded with prompts to sign up for and subscribe to all sorts of email communications. So, as a brand, when someone takes the time to sift through all the chaos to intentionally sign up for your email communications, it’s a big deal. To acknowledge how grateful they are to the folks who actually take their time to subscribe, Kate Spade uses a simple but effective tactic with their welcome emails. They say “Thank You” in big, bold lettering. What I like: To be honest, I am a big fan of what this email looks like. The envelope graphic — which virtually simulates the joy of receiving a physical thank you note — is a nifty and visually appealing way to draw attention to the email.  Munk Pank’s welcome email is the story of why the company was founded. This is a healthy snack store founded by a husband and wife. In their welcome email, they mention that they started the company because they never seemed to find nutritious snacks to keep them energized and on the go. In my opinion, this is an excellent version of a welcome email. The brand lets its customers know they can relate to the problems they’re facing and that they’ve been there. This helps in building trust and relatability. It also gives customers a peek into what they should expect from their products. The email ends by sharing the company’s mission to help them live a healthy lifestyle. I also like how this welcome email lets subscribers know that they’re joining a tribe that is concerned about their healthy eating and lifestyle, a mission that goes beyond snacks. What I like: A personal message from the founder gives the product a face and acknowledges the brand’s dedication to making people’s lives healthier.  Who Gives a Crap is an organization that sells organic toilet paper, and they’re passionate about it. I found their welcome email to be equally fun and informative. They state all the reasons why you should opt for organic and eco-friendly products. Then, they sweeten the pot (pun intended) by noting that they donate 50% of their profits to global sanitation projects. The email reminds the buyer that they still get the toilet paper at the same price they do in the supermarket. It also has a compelling CTA in its welcome email: 10% off its products for people who subscribe to its email list. The company added its “Shop Now” button for convenience, so if readers are convinced to buy, they can do so in one click. What I like: I like that the email is written entirely in a playful tone while the message is extremely clear about the company’s nature-friendly principle and donation policy. This creates a message that is both fun and informative, and it becomes something that someone will remember for a long time if it is their first experience with the business.  SAXX Underwear specializes in men’s underwear, and its welcome email is very catchy and creative. The subject line, “Welcome to you and your balls,” is just a taste of how the company uses a humorous and relatable tone to connect with its audience. Their welcome email is visual, too. It demonstrates their comfort guarantee with images of models wearing their boxers. The welcome email also gives a 10% off code for first-time buyers and directs them to their store. To me, what really stands out in the SAXX Underwear welcome email is the tone of the copy and the careful yet bold and catchy choice of words. What I like: I’m impressed by the sincerity of the brand in the first email when it presents the refund policy. Knowing that they can return the product very easily if they are not fully satisfied with the brand’s items makes the customers who are choosing a product for the first time feel more confident, and as a result, they might try the products.  When you sign up for InVision’s free prototyping app, the welcome email makes your next step very clear. To guide people on how to use InVision’s app, the company’s welcome email doesn’t simply list out what you need to do to get started. Instead, it shows you what you need to do with a series of quick videos. Given the visual, interactive nature of the product, this makes a lot of sense. What I like: I find this welcome email particularly helpful. In fact, it offers a step-by-step guide to further interactions. This highlights the user-friendliness that the company provides, along with the smooth onboarding process.  Inbound attracts business professionals from all over the world. I believe that is the reason why its event confirmation email is simple and easy to follow, with useful links for event information, help, and accessibility. Keep scrolling, and you’ll see even more useful additions, like: What I like: I like how this all-in-one approach of the welcome email ensures that even if people who wish to attend only see one email, it will include everything they need.  Nonprofit marketing can be a challenge, but this email sheds light on endless possibilities. In this welcome email, donors to Creative Capital get a healthy dose of inspiration. The email begins with a striking GIF that combines the work of supported artists with bright thank-you messages. It continues with a poetic message about the types of artists the org supports. This is a chance to inspire every donor. It reminds them who their donation is supporting and why that action has massive value. What I like: I really like how the animated GIF at the email’s beginning does all that to catch the attention and set the tone for the rest of the message.  Frequent shoppers can end up in more loyalty programs than they can count, so it’s important for these welcome emails to stand out and show off a big offer. From the start, this email focuses on concrete rewards. Then, it gives a clear explanation of Baltic Born’s reward system. It continues with a button that compels the recipient to get more points. And, the monochromatic design is attractive but not distracting or overwhelming, making it easy to read on mobile devices. What I like: The effective part of the email is that it tells everything about the loyalty program in a straightforward way and gives easy guidelines on how to get the points. This makes it easy for me to engage with the brand and feel rewarded for my loyalty.

Best regards, [Signature] Confirmation emails can sometimes feel cold or impersonal, so this is another email where it’s vital to add some welcome. A confirmation email assures your subscriber or buyer that they’ve successfully completed the signup. It’s also a chance to share useful information to make them feel more comfortable about what comes next. For example, you might want to add order details, shipping, or the day of the week your newsletter comes out. Based on my understanding of customer experience, personalizing this welcome email can go a long way toward building trust with your subscribers.

This welcome email has a specific goal — to turn that free trial into a paying customer. With that in mind, it’s important to strike a balance. This email should point out tips, features, and details but not overwhelm with too much information. Hi [First name]! Thank you for signing up for your free trial of [product or Company name].

All best, [Signature] Your new customer welcome email often marks the beginning of the customer relationship. This email usually contains a lot of information. It might include order confirmation, product information, helpful tips, or a review request. At the same time, I believe it needs to set a tone that emphasizes the character and value of your brand and products. So, it needs to be welcoming, engaging, and encouraging. Hi [Customer], This is really exciting: Welcome (officially) to [your product or service here]. We’re so lucky to have you. [I/we] are here to help make sure you get the results you expect from [your product or service], so don’t hesitate to reach out with questions. [I’d/we’d] love to hear from you.

Looking forward to hearing from you, [Your company/name] In my experience, discount codes always make great welcome emails. This is because they lead with something your subscriber wants. It encourages a purchase, but this email is also a chance to show appreciation, develop brand awareness, or boost new products. To make the most of these emails, I always try to add limited-time or occasion-specific offers. This adds urgency and gives you a chance to quickly boost your customer relationship.

[Signature] Some customers will get more than one welcome email from you, so it’s important to make your welcome email specific. One example is your customer loyalty program. When someone signs up to be an affiliate or joins an incentive program for your brand, they need a different kind of welcome. As you draft this email, focus on personalized connection. Whether you’re offering thanks for their support, sharing sneak peeks, or giving exclusive offers, each customer needs to feel special. Use surveys, interactive features, and integrations to collect feedback from current customers. Then, once your subscribers become loyal customers, you can use these tools to make your loyalty welcome email super personal. Hey [First name], Welcome to [Brand loyalty program]!

Thank you again for your donation and for choosing to be a part of [Nonprofit Organization name]’s vision. Best regards, [Signature] Now that you’ve seen some great examples of welcome emails and templates, let’s dig into the process of writing a great email and catching customer attention. Eight templates to lead your new customers through their first several months with your product or service All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Who your email is from might matter more than what it says. If your subscriber doesn’t recognize the name in their inbox, they’re more likely to ignore it — or worse, mark it as spam. Keep it familiar and human. If you’re a solopreneur, your first name might be enough. If you’re a brand, consider a hybrid. “Jeanne Jennings, Email Optimization Shop” strikes the balance between personal and professional. Pro tip: Whatever you choose, be consistent. The inbox is no place for identity crises. The welcome email begins before your subscriber opens it. Your subject line and preheader text are the red carpet moment — and you want to give them a reason to not just open but click. Avoid sounding like a robot (“Welcome to Our Newsletter”) or an apology (“Thanks, I guess”). Instead, try something a little more human: “You’re in. Let’s make email magic.” Pair that with a preheader like “What to expect — and one quick thing to do next.” Example: Subject line: “Glad you’re here, let’s get started.” Preheader: “Peek at what’s coming (and how to make the most of it).” Now’s not the time for “Dear Valued Subscriber.” Use their first name if you have it, and speak like a person. If your brand voice is upbeat and chatty, lead with enthusiasm. If it’s calm and informative, keep it warm but grounded. And skip the “on behalf of the team” stuff. Just talk to the reader, one-to-one. Example: “Hi Kyle, I’m so glad you’re here. You just joined a smart group of folks who want to get more strategic (and frankly, more fun) with their email marketing. Let’s get started.” Gratitude goes a long way. A simple “thanks for joining” creates a positive tone, but go one step further by reminding them why they’re here. Reaffirm their decision. If they signed up for a checklist, mention it. If they subscribed out of curiosity, give them a preview of what’s to come. Anchor the moment in their motivation, not your brand agenda. Example: “Thanks for signing up to get smarter about your email program. Whether you’re here for strategy, inspiration, or the occasional subject line rant, I’ve got you covered.” The inbox is a competitive place, especially for a newcomer. Your welcome email should offer a clear win right away. That could be a resource (“Download Your Welcome Series Planner”), a recommendation (“Here are 3 popular posts to start with”), or even a surprising tip. This shows your emails aren’t just filler. They’re useful, timely, and worth their spot in the inbox. Example: “Here’s a subscriber-only worksheet to map your next three campaigns. Grab it here.” Let your subscriber know what kind of content you’ll send, how often, and when. Setting expectations up front not only builds trust, it also keeps your list clean by deterring folks who might otherwise be surprised and unsubscribe at the first campaign. This can be a quick bullet list or a sentence or two. Example: “You’ll hear from me about once a week, usually on Tuesdays. Expect strategy tips, campaign breakdowns, and occasional deep dives into subject lines that should have stayed in draft.” Don’t bury your ask in a pile of links. Decide what the next best action is for your reader, then build your email around that. And make sure your button is bulletproof: styled with HTML, not dependent on images, and clear even if the pictures don’t load. Your CTA should answer this question: What should I do next? Example: “Download Your Campaign Planner” “Browse Our Favorite Resources” “Tell Me Your Email Goals” People trust people. A short testimonial, a sentence about your brand’s origin, or a quote from a happy customer can humanize your message and reinforce credibility. This isn’t about overselling; it’s about showing that your email list is a trusted place to be. Example: “This list includes everyone from solo entrepreneurs to email directors at Fortune 500s, folks who want better results without gimmicks. You’re in good company.” Don’t ghost at the end. Wrap up with a warm sign-off and leave the door open for conversation or connection. If appropriate, invite them to follow you on social or reply with a question. This reinforces that this isn’t a one-way blast — it’s the beginning of a relationship. Example: “Glad to have you here. If you want to say hi, or tell me what you’re working on, just hit reply. I read every one. Be safe, stay well, Jeanne.” Welcome emails aren’t just for customers. The onboarding process has a huge impact on how new employees feel about your company, so it’s important to give it the time and energy it deserves. One of the important parts of this process is the onboarding welcome email. It has to match the company’s tone and outline all the expectations you have for the new employee. Here are the steps that I follow when writing an onboarding email. This isn’t just an announcement — it’s a personal moment. Your subject line should reflect that. Skip the sterile stuff (“Welcome to the Company”) and try something a little more you. Think: “We’re so glad you’re here!” “Welcome to Team [Company Name], Jamie!” “Big day. Big welcome. Let’s do this.” This is one of those rare cases where exclamation points are completely acceptable. The email should come from someone the new hire will actually interact with, like their manager, team lead, or even the CEO if the org is small enough. “HR Department” sounds like paperwork. “Natalie from Marketing” sounds like a person who’s excited to meet them. Bonus points if their manager or buddy also sends a follow-up note later that day. A welcome email should sound like a welcome message, not a copy-paste. Use their name. Reference their role. Show that you know who they are, not just what position they’re filling. If possible, include a line about why they’re a great fit or what the team’s looking forward to. Example: “Hi Alex — We’re so excited you’re officially part of the team! Your experience with user-centered design is going to make a huge impact here, and I know the product team can’t wait to dive in with you.” The welcome email is a prime opportunity to introduce (or reinforce) your company culture. Not with a five-paragraph mission statement, but with a short, genuine expression of what matters around here. Are you big on collaboration? Do you celebrate learning? This is your moment to set that tone. Example: “Around here, we value curiosity, collaboration, and GIFs in Slack. You’ll see what we mean soon.” Let them know what to expect on Day 1 or Week 1. You don’t need to attach the whole onboarding manual (please don’t), but a simple bullet list or short paragraph helps reduce anxiety and sets clear expectations. Example: “Here’s what your first day will look like: We’ll walk you through everything, so no pressure to memorize this.” If there’s anything they need to read, fill out, or review ahead of time, make it easy to find. Avoid dumping six links with zero context. Instead, frame it as “Here’s what’s most helpful to look at before Day 1.” And please, no passive-aggressive all-caps PDFs like “MANDATORY POLICY 2021_FINAL_FINAL2.” Example: “If you want a head start, here are two quick reads: Starting a new job can be nerve-wracking, even in the best orgs. Let them know who they can reach out to and that no question is too small. Make it clear you want them to ask now, not suffer silently later. Example: “If anything’s unclear, or even if you’re wondering what to wear Monday, reply here. There are no wrong questions. We’ve all been the new kid.” Wrap it up with warmth. Sign off like a person, not a department. Even if this is the first in a series of onboarding messages, this one should feel personal and upbeat. Example: “Can’t wait to see all you’ll do here. Enjoy the weekend. Monday’s going to be a great start. — Casey (and all of Team Design)” So here’s my challenge to you: Don’t waste the welcome. Don’t treat it like just another transactional message or onboarding task to check off. Whether you’re speaking to someone who just joined your email list or someone about to walk into your office (or Slack channel), that first email matters more than you think. Write it like you mean it. Lead with real value, not a sales pitch or a policy doc. Be clear about what’s coming next. And most importantly, let your human voice come through. You’ve already earned their initial trust: that click, that signature, that “yes.” Now’s your chance to build on it. You only get one “first email.” Make it count.

  The inbox is having her moment again. Newsletters have made a full-blown comeback, and the rules of play have gotten a little more … complicated.  The concept of newsletters has evolved from just sending emails to a sophisticated ecosystem of automated platforms, personalization strategies, and monetization models. To help break down the latest trends, we surveyed 400+ newsletter professionals to understand exactly how today's creators are growing subscribers, generating revenue, and preparing for an AI-driven future. Here’s what you need to know from HubSpot's 2025 State of Newsletters Report. Table of Contents Want to take a closer look? Download the full report here: Your Guide to Building a Profitable Media Empire All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Newsletters are H-O-T right now, and there’s a lot to keep in mind when building out a good strategy. Here are the topics that the pros are regularly following to inform their approach: Basically, keeping a pulse on industry trends helps them decide which platforms and new features are available, and stay current on the most recent developments in AI and data privacy. In the spirit of staying in the know, we found that the majority of our respondents (30%) are using their industry-related personal opinions, tips, or hot takes to anchor their content strategy. News and trends, along with original data and research, are tied for second.  As far as topic coverage goes, 42% of newsletter pros are all in on content related to their industry, professional field, or similar career paths. Content mixing is also popular, with 25% of respondents covering a blend of content related to their career, hobbies, and/or entertainment. To distribute said content, the following channels surfaced as the three most popular for publishing:  And when it comes to content consumption, subscribers are overwhelmingly using Gmail over other email inboxes to read your newsletters. Our survey revealed a 120% jump in usage by comparison. Despite this revelation, the majority of our respondents still agree that web-based platforms (like Substack and Beehiiv) are the way forward. 62% said that newsletter creators who leverage these platforms will get ahead of those who are focused solely on the inbox. Outside of email hosting platforms, newsletter pros told us they’re getting the most ROI out of the following tools: Just a few things to consider for your newsletter tech stack if you haven’t already. Now, let’s get personal. Because personalization is the name of the newsletter game these days. We found that 90% of newsletter creators actively tailor their strategy to their most prominent subscriber demographics. And 67% of respondents agree that subscribers will expect newsletters to have a much higher level of personalization in 2030 than they do today.  Based on our survey, the most popular strategies for catering newsletters to the most prominent subscriber demographics are: Despite these strategies, newsletter pros are still facing challenges with subscriber growth, especially as the newsletter industry becomes more saturated. To increase subscribers, 42% of respondents ranked direct recommendations, via word of mouth or online, from current subscribers as the most effective strategy, followed by brands or co-marketing partners sharing the newsletter on their own channels. Before we move on from the subject of personalization, we decided to do some digging into the revenue differences between newsletter creators who cater to their subscribers' preferences and those who don’t. For respondents who don’t use any personalization, we found that they are among those generating lower revenue — 23% report making $0 per month, and 43% report earning between $1 and $100 per month. In other words, it literally pays to personalize.  Here are some other revenue trends to note: For those who are dabbling with newsletter ads and wondering if they’re on the right track, I have some good news. 46% of respondents agree that newsletters generate ad revenue more quickly than podcasts, videos, or websites. Shifting gears to performance, surveyed newsletter pros said the metrics they most often track are views (58%), followed by clicks or click rate (35%) and engagement metrics (30%). Here are the average reported rates for key newsletter performance metrics:  We also found that newsletters featuring industry-related personal opinions, tips, or hot takes drive the highest open rates, click rates, and conversion rates — so, it’s no surprise that creators are leveraging this content strategy the most. Mixed-media newsletter content (i.e., text combined with video or imagery) is also driving the highest performance among the newsletter pros surveyed. Congrats! You made it to the AI section of this article because there’s no way I wouldn’t mention our favorite industry disruptor. We asked newsletter pros how, if at all, they’re using AI in their newsletter processes. Here’s what they said:  Plus, 42% of newsletter pros who use AI said it saves them between one and three hours a week on average. Only a small percentage of respondents (4%) said they don’t use AI in any way, shape, or form, and don’t plan to. However, 64% of respondents do in fact agree that newsletters will be AI-generated by 2030. The newsletter industry is moving fast. Our pros predict that the main factors driving the evolution of newsletters over the next year will be AI integration, personalization and customization, increased competition and saturation, and a growing demand for valuable and authentic content in the era of AI. As for the state of newsletters, I can’t lie. It’s a little … chaotic (but in a good way). As long as you continue to show up consistently and deliver genuine relevance to your audience, you’ll always be well-equipped to ride the next industry wave.

  Running a financial-services business is about far more than moving money in and out of accounts — it’s about managing client trust, regulatory complexity, personalized advice, ongoing service relationships, and layered compliance. The challenge? CRM needs in the financial services industry are uniquely demanding. Firms must track high-value clients, nurture relationships over long horizons, monitor referrals and regulatory touches, segment based on asset classes or risk profiles, deliver timely compliance-safe email communication, and do all of this while maintaining a polished, secure, and scalable marketing system.  That’s where a thoughtful email marketing tool (or CRM with strong email capabilities) becomes a solution. When properly configured, a CRM becomes your operational backbone, enabling you to centralize client data, automate compliant email follow-ups, segment clients by product or asset class, trigger campaigns when life events or portfolio thresholds change, and maintain the audit trail and data governance necessary for financial services. In this article, you’ll get: It’s also worth noting that real financial services companies already use HubSpot. In the following sections, we’ll examine how other tools compare to HubSpot (and each other) and identify which ones offer the best fit for financial services marketers and operations teams in 2025. Table of Contents Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for financial service businesses is the practice of using targeted, permission-based email communication to build trust, educate clients, and nurture long-term relationships in a regulated industry. Unlike retail or eCommerce campaigns that focus on quick conversions, email marketing in financial services emphasizes credibility, compliance, and consistency. Advisors, lenders, and wealth managers use email to deliver timely market insights, policy updates, product announcements, and personalized advice — all while maintaining strict data privacy and communication standards. The goal isn’t just to sell a service; it’s to position your firm as a trusted advisor who provides ongoing value and transparency. When done right, email marketing becomes a scalable way to: In short, email marketing for financial service businesses bridges the gap between relationship-driven trust and digital efficiency, helping firms deliver the right message to the right client at the right time.

Manual tracking of email approvals, archiving conversations, and maintaining audit trails consumes hours of administrative time while leaving firms vulnerable to compliance violations that can result in hefty fines. Plus, HubSpot’s compliance integrations can: When advisors create emails in HubSpot, its compliance tracking features flag potentially problematic language, route content through designated compliance officers for pre-approval, and timestamp all modifications. Financial advisors struggle to maintain personalized communication with hundreds of clients while managing portfolios, attending meetings, and staying current on market conditions. Breeze AI analyzes client data including: For instance, HubSpot’s Breeze-generated subject lines can increase open rates by crafting messages like “John, your tech holdings outperformed the S&P by 12%” rather than generic “Q3 Market Update” subject lines. Pro tip: HubSpot’s smart content rules dynamically adjust email sections based on client segmentsc (i.e., ensuring young professionals receive 401(k) maximization tips while retirees see RMD reminders). Financial advisors spend significant time outside the office meeting clients at their homes, attending networking events, or traveling between appointments, yet critical client information often remains trapped on desktop systems. This disconnect leads to missed opportunities when advisors can’t access portfolio details during impromptu client encounters or update meeting notes before details fade from memory. HubSpot’s mobile CRM app provides complete access to client records, email history, and portfolio data from any device, allowing advisors to pull up account information during meetings or log touchpoints immediately after leaving a client’s office. Financial marketing teams struggle to demonstrate how their email campaigns translate into actual AUM growth or new client acquisition, often relying on vanity metrics like open rates that don’t connect to revenue. Without clear attribution between marketing efforts and business outcomes, firms continue investing in ineffective strategies while missing opportunities to scale successful campaigns. Luckily, HubSpot’s multi-touch attribution reporting tracks the complete client journey, revealing exactly which content drives conversions. For example, HubSpot’s revenue attribution dashboard can show that clients who engaged with retirement calculator emails subsequently rolled over an average of $450,000 in 401(k) assets, while those receiving only market commentary averaged $125,000 — providing clear direction for content strategy and budget allocation. Financial service teams waste countless hours on repetitive tasks like sending appointment reminders, following up on incomplete applications, and manually segmenting clients for quarterly review outreach. This administrative overhead prevents advisors from focusing on high-value activities like financial planning and relationship building. HubSpot’s workflow automation builder creates sophisticated trigger-based sequences that handle routine communications without human intervention, which automatically: Lastly, HubSpot’s customizable email templates maintains brand consistency while allowing quick personalization. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Start by documenting your financial service firm’s unique processes across client acquisition, onboarding, and retention cycles. Financial planners typically manage multiple parallel workflows, including: Then, map out your current manual processes, identifying where emails are triggered (like after a prospect downloads a retirement guide), what approvals are needed (compliance review for market commentary), and which team members are involved at each stage. Consider the complexity of financial product sales cycles that can span months, requiring sophisticated nurture sequences that adapt based on life events like job changes, inheritance receipt, or approaching retirement dates. Pro tip: Document integration points where your email marketing must connect with portfolio management systems, custodian platforms, and financial planning software to maintain data consistency. Financial service businesses require specialized capabilities beyond standard email marketing, with regulatory compliance topping the list of non-negotiable features. Your platform must include: Look for behavioral tracking that identifies when prospects transition from research to decision mode — such as multiple retirement calculator uses or repeated visits to rollover guides — triggering timely advisor alerts. Additionally, mobile access is essential for advisors meeting clients outside the office, while advanced segmentation capabilities must handle complex criteria like asset levels, risk tolerance, age brackets, and product ownership. Ensure the platform offers dynamic content blocks that automatically adjust messaging based on client life stage. Next, evaluate how quickly your team can become proficient with each platform, considering that financial advisors often have limited technical expertise and even less time for extensive training. Request hands-on trials where your actual team members (not just IT staff) create email campaigns, set up automation workflows, and generate compliance reports to assess real-world usability. Additionally, don’t forget to consider the learning curve for different user roles: Assess vendor support quality by testing response times with financial industry-specific questions about regulatory features, checking whether they offer dedicated onboarding specialists who understand financial services, and evaluating the depth of their knowledge base for self-service troubleshooting. Platform adoption succeeds when the interface feels familiar to users accustomed to financial software, with terminology that matches industry conventions like “AUM” instead of “deal size” and “client households” rather than “companies.” Calculate the true cost of ownership beyond initial license fees, factoring in how pricing scales as your firm grows AUM, adds advisors, and expands client databases. Many platforms charge per contact or email send, which can exponentially increase costs for financial firms maintaining large prospect databases for long-term nurturing, especially when considering that financial planning prospects may take years to convert. Evaluate whether the platform includes essential financial features in base pricing or requires expensive add-ons for compliance archiving, advanced automation, or CRM functionality that are non-negotiable for your operations. Heavily consider hidden costs like: Compare pricing models carefully — per-user pricing may seem expensive initially but often provides better value than per-contact models for financial firms with small teams managing large client bases. Select a platform that can evolve with your financial service business from solo advisory practice to multi-advisor firm without requiring a complete system migration. Look for solutions offering modular upgrades where you can start with basic email marketing then add advanced automation, compliance management, or multi-touch attribution as your AUM grows. HubSpot exemplifies this scalability — financial planning firms can begin with free CRM tools then progressively adopt Starter, Professional, or Enterprise tiers while maintaining consistent client records and regulatory documentation. Franchise Brokers Association, a membership organization supporting entrepreneurs, achieved a 216% increase in lead generation, 60% increase in deal closures, and unified their fragmented data systems, all by using HubSpot’s Marketing Hub. Marketing Hub’s flexibility enabled automated member onboarding workflows, boosted content production organization-wide, and consolidated reporting for leadership decision-making. Franchise Brokers Association’s success proves that an investment in HubSpot means growth without limitations (or frustration), allowing financial advisors to create custom objects for investment products and insurance policies, build specialized workflows for different client segments, and, most importantly, achieve measurable AUM growth that justifies marketing spend to compliance officers and firm partners. Before creating any email content, establish clear objectives aligned with measurable financial outcomes like: Then, document your compliance requirements including SEC and FINRA regulations for client communications, required disclosures for investment products, and approval workflows for market commentary or performance discussions. Pro tip: Set up HubSpot’s compliance tracking features to route all campaigns through designated compliance officers for pre-send approval, ensuring every email meets regulatory standards without slowing down your marketing velocity. Move beyond basic demographic segmentation to create sophisticated audience groups based on: Additionally, HubSpot’s lead scoring tools automatically identifies prospects transitioning from research to decision mode by tracking engagement patterns like multiple retirement calculator uses or repeated downloads of estate planning guides. Then, build dynamic sequences in HubSpot that update automatically as clients’ situations change — moving them from “young professional” segments to “growing family” campaigns when they add beneficiaries or open 529 accounts. Leverage HubSpot’s Breeze AI to generate compelling subject lines and email copy that resonates with specific financial planning needs while maintaining compliance standards. Next, use HubSpot’s drag-and-drop email designer with pre-built financial services templates that include compliant disclaimers, dynamic content sequences that adjust based on client segments, and mobile-responsive layouts optimized for advisors reviewing emails between client meetings. Build sophisticated multi-touch campaigns using HubSpot’s custom report builder that nurtures prospects through lengthy financial planning sales cycles with perfectly timed touchpoints. Afterwards, create branching workflows in HubSpot’s automation engine that adapt based on prospect actions, sending different sequences for term life insurance inquiries versus whole life interest, while maintaining personalized follow-up cadences that respect the longer decision timelines in financial services. Test every element of your financial services emails using HubSpot’s built-in A/B testing tools that automatically determine statistical significance and declare winners based on your chosen success metrics. Run split tests on subject lines comparing urgency-based messaging (“Only 3 days left for 2024 IRA contributions”) versus benefit-focused approaches (“Maximize your tax deduction with IRA contributions”) to identify what motivates your specific client base. Pro tip: Use HubSpot’s Complete A/B Testing Kit to elevate your email marketing tactics. Preview every email across devices using HubSpot’s mobile optimization tools, ensuring critical CTAs remain visible and clickable for advisors and clients checking emails on smartphones during commutes or between meetings. Run final compliance checks through HubSpot’s approval workflow system that logs reviewer comments, tracks version changes, and maintains an audit trail showing exactly who approved each campaign element before sending. Pro tip: Activate HubSpot’s send time optimization feature that analyzes historical engagement data to deliver emails when individual recipients are most likely to open them — crucial for time-sensitive market updates or deadline-driven communications about contribution limits. Track campaign performance using HubSpot’s real-time analytics dashboard that goes beyond vanity metrics to show actual business impact like influenced revenue, new AUM acquired, and client lifetime value changes. Lastly, configure custom reports in HubSpot that connect email engagement to downstream activities like appointment bookings, account openings, and portfolio transfers, proving marketing's contribution to firm growth. HubSpot stands out as the most comprehensive email marketing solution for financial service companies, combining robust compliance features with sophisticated automation capabilities that address the industry’s unique requirements. As previously mentioned, HubSpot’s built-in compliance software automatically archive all client communications with timestamps, route content through designated compliance officers for pre-approval, and maintain searchable audit trails that satisfy SEC and FINRA examination requirements. Unlike generic email platforms that require costly add-ons or custom development for financial services functionality, HubSpot includes native features like: What features should I look for in email marketing tools for financial planning companies? Financial planning companies should prioritize five critical features when evaluating email marketing platforms: Furthermore, the platform must handle sophisticated segmentation based on: Pro tip: Look for platforms that offer pre-built compliance templates flagging problematic language like “guaranteed returns,” role-based permissions ensuring only authorized team members approve client communications, and multi-touch attribution reporting that connects email campaigns directly to AUM growth and client acquisition metrics. HubSpot excels in financial services environments by providing purpose-built features that address strict regulatory requirements while enabling sophisticated client engagement strategies that drive AUM growth. Plus, HubSpot’s Breeze AI analyzes: Financial firms using HubSpot’s Marketing Hub report 58% more deals closed, allowing advisors to focus on high-value activities like financial planning rather than manual email management. Email marketing software for financial services typically ranges from $20/month for basic platforms to $3,600+/month for enterprise solutions, with pricing models varying between per-user, per-contact, and flat-rate structures. When calculating total cost of ownership, financial firms must consider hidden expenses including implementation fees ($5,000 to $50,000), data migration charges, training requirements, and ongoing consulting needs, plus the opportunity cost of advisors spending hours on manual tasks that proper automation eliminates. Per-contact pricing models can become prohibitively expensive for financial firms maintaining large prospect databases for long-term nurturing — a firm with 10,000 contacts might pay $500 to $2,000 monthly on platforms like ActiveCampaign or Mailchimp, while HubSpot’s user-based model provides better value for small teams managing extensive client bases. Pro tip: HubSpot offers transparent tiered pricing starting at $9/month for Starter, $800/month for Professional, and $3,600/month for Enterprise, including essential compliance features in base packages rather than requiring expensive add-ons like many competitors. Email marketing software designed for financial services automates the complex compliance requirements that can otherwise consume hours of manual documentation and expose firms to regulatory penalties ranging from $10,000 to millions in fines. Platforms like HubSpot include: Additionally, a CRM software’s role-based permissions ensure only authorized personnel can approve external communications, while automated retention policies preserve emails for the required timeframes (typically 3 to 7 years depending on communication type) and securely purge outdated records according to regulatory guidelines. Pro tip: During SEC or FINRA examinations, firms using compliant email marketing platforms can instantly produce required documentation showing approval chains, modification histories, and complete client communication records. HubSpot stands out as the premier email marketing solution for financial service companies, offering enterprise-level compliance and automation capabilities at a price point that scales with firm growth. Unlike traditional financial CRM systems that charge per asset under management or require expensive custom compliance modules, HubSpot’s CRM provides built-in regulatory features starting at just $9/month, making sophisticated email marketing accessible to solo advisors and billion-dollar RIAs alike. HubSpot transformed NQM Funding’s high-touch broker relationships by unifying their fragmented communication systems into one scalable platform that could grow with their expanding network of specific broker segments. Over the course of their implementation period, the organization achieved a remarkable 900% increase in contact growth by leveraging HubSpot’s Marketing Hub. All-in-all, HubSpot’s true power for financial services lies in its comprehensive approach — combining regulatory compliance, sophisticated automation, and measurable ROI tracking in one platform.

  Planning events is about more than venue bookings and catering — it’s about orchestrating countless moving pieces, building relationships, delivering memorable experiences, and sustaining them over time. The challenge? CRM needs in the event-planning industry are uniquely demanding. Event-planning businesses must juggle multiple stakeholders (clients, vendors, attendees, and sponsors), shifting timelines, varied event formats (virtual, hybrid, and live), and the need to both scale and personalize communications — all at once.  Generic CRMs often struggle to meet these demands: they don’t always support multi-channel attendee journeys, complex registration flows, sponsor and vendor tracking, or the seamless follow-up needed to turn one-off attendees into repeat event advocates. That’s where a CRM built (or configured) for the event industry becomes a solution. A properly chosen CRM becomes your operational backbone: it lets you centralize attendee, client and vendor data; automate email sequences for invitations, reminders, and post-event follow-ups; segment contacts by event type or role (vendor versus sponsor versus attendee); integrate registration and ticketing systems; and track engagement and ROI across your event lifecycle. In this article, you’ll get: And just so you know: HubSpot is already used by real event-planning companies — for example, event organizations report saving thousands of hours annually after switching to HubSpot’s event-centric workflows. So, if you’re ready to cut through the chaos, streamline your attendee/vendor/client communications, and bring real ROI to your events business in 2025, read on. Table of Contents: Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for event planning businesses is the strategic use of email to promote events, manage attendee relationships, and drive engagement before, during, and after an event. In this industry, email isn’t just about announcements — it’s about creating a seamless attendee journey. From the first save-the-date invitation to post-event thank-you messages, email marketing helps event professionals nurture relationships with clients, sponsors, vendors, and guests at every stage of the planning process. Effective email marketing lets event planners: In short, email marketing acts as the connective tissue of an event-planning business — turning one-time guests into repeat clients and loyal brand advocates through timely, relevant, and automated communication.

Event planners typically spend countless hours manually sending confirmation emails, reminders, and post-event surveys — time that could be spent securing sponsors or improving attendee experiences. Email marketing software eliminates this administrative burden through intelligent automation that handles the entire attendee journey. HubSpot’s workflow automation builder enables event teams to create multi-step campaigns that trigger based on registration actions. These campaigns automatically send personalized confirmations within seconds of sign-up, provide parking instructions 24 hours prior to the event, and include feedback surveys after the event concludes. Plus, by implementing HubSpot’s pre-built event workflow templates, planning teams can significantly reduce manual email tasks while ensuring no attendee falls through the cracks, whether managing a 50-person workshop or a 5,000-attendee conference. The industry-wide challenge of no-shows costs event planners money in wasted catering, materials, and venue capacity; however, email marketing platforms provide the analytics to help improve these numbers. Modern email software tracks open rates, click patterns, and engagement timing to identify which messages actually drive attendance versus those ignored in crowded inboxes. HubSpot’s Breeze AI analyzes historical event data to automatically optimize subject lines and send times for each segment, helping event planners to improve their attendance rates when utilizing HubSpot's predictive sending features. Additionally, HubSpot’s A/B testing tools allow teams to experiment with different reminder frequencies and messaging styles, providing precise data on whether attendees respond better to “last chance” urgency or exclusive “VIP preview” framing. Event planning companies juggling multiple simultaneous events often struggle with scattered attendee information across spreadsheets, registration platforms, and email lists, leading to duplicate communications or missed VIP recognitions. Email marketing CRMs create a single source of truth that tracks every attendee interaction from initial interest through post-event engagement. HubSpot’s unified contact database automatically syncs with popular event platforms, such as Eventbrite and Zoom Events, while maintaining complete histories of which events each contact attended, their ticket types, and engagement levels. This centralization through HubSpot’s Marketing Hub means planners can instantly identify that a registrant attended three previous conferences as a VIP, automatically triggering premium treatment and early-access offers without manual research or risk of overlooking loyal attendees. Growing event companies face the paradox of needing more personalized communication as their attendee base expands, yet lacking the resources to write individual emails to hundreds or thousands of registrants. Email marketing software enables mass personalization that maintains the boutique touch attendees expect from premium events. HubSpot’s smart content dynamically adjusts email sections based on attendee attributes, displaying different agenda highlights to speakers versus sponsors, or customizing meal options according to previously indicated dietary preferences. Additionally, with HubSpot’s personalization tokens and Breeze AI, a single team member can: Event planning companies often struggle to prove the value of their marketing efforts to stakeholders, relying on basic metrics like registration numbers that don’t tell the complete story of campaign effectiveness. Comprehensive email marketing platforms provide attribution reporting that connects specific campaigns to: HubSpot’s attribution reporting dashboard tracks the complete journey from first email open to ticket purchase, showing exactly which campaigns drive the highest-value registrations and which messages convert free attendees to paid tickets. By leveraging HubSpot’s custom reporting builder, event teams can demonstrate clear ROI from their email campaigns, whether that’s ticket sales from early-bird promotions or new sponsorships generated through HubSpot’s sequences tool, providing concrete data that secures continued marketing investment. Before evaluating any email marketing platform, document your complete event lifecycle from initial promotion through post-event follow-up. Start by outlining each touchpoint in your attendee journey, including: Identify which communications are currently manual versus automated, noting pain points like sending individual sponsor updates or coordinating speaker confirmations. Then, consider the complexity of your events — do you manage single-day workshops or multi-track conferences with VIP tiers? Map how data flows between your registration platform, payment processor, and communication tools. This workflow visualization reveals whether you need basic email broadcasting or sophisticated automation with branching logic based on attendee behavior, helping narrow your platform requirements before entering the evaluation phase. Create a prioritized list distinguishing between essential capabilities and nice-to-have features based on your mapped workflows. Essential features for event planners typically include: Next, consider your team’s technical expertise — do you need drag-and-drop simplicity or are you comfortable with HTML customization? Evaluate whether you require advanced capabilities like dynamic content personalization for different attendee segments, attribution reporting to prove event ROI, or multi-channel coordination across email and SMS. Pro tip: Don’t forget operational necessities like list segmentation for speakers versus sponsors, GDPR compliance tools for international events, and the ability to quickly send urgent updates about schedule changes or weather delays. Request trials of your top platforms and have your actual event team test core functions they'll use daily. Evaluate how quickly team members can create and send a basic event invitation without technical support (if it takes more than 30 minutes, consider the productivity impact across dozens of annual events). Test the learning curve for advanced features: can your coordinators build automated workflows independently, or will you need ongoing IT involvement? Assess the quality of customer support, particularly during critical pre-event periods when you can't afford delays. Once you’ve done all of this, review the vendor’s training resources, looking for: Calculate total cost of ownership beyond base subscription fees, factoring in your expected growth over the next 2 to 3 years. Most platforms price by contact volume, so project costs if your database grows from 5,000 to 15,000 contacts as you add events. Include hidden expenses like overage charges for: Lastly, compare pricing models — some platforms charge per email sent while others offer unlimited sending to your contact limit. Factor in potential savings from consolidated tools; replacing separate email, survey, and landing page services with an all-in-one platform might justify higher upfront costs. Pro tip: Request custom quotes if you’re managing over 10,000 contacts or 50+ events annually, as enterprise pricing often includes negotiable discounts and additional support resources. Select a platform that can evolve with your event business from intimate workshops to large-scale conferences without requiring a complete system migration. Look for solutions offering modular upgrades where you can start with basic email marketing then add advanced automation, CRM capabilities, or reporting tools as needs develop. HubSpot exemplifies this scalability — event planning companies can begin with free email marketing tools then progressively adopt Starter, Professional, or Enterprise tiers while maintaining consistent workflows and historical data. Clearwing, a high-end audio, lighting, video, and staging systems company, managed 500+ campaign assets for AVL Expo, an audio, video, and lighting technology conference, generated 250+ leads, and delivered 4,200% ROI, all by using Marketing Hub. Marketing Hub’s flexibility lead to faster campaign launches, stronger event attendance, and more engaged, loyal prospects. Clearwing’s success proves that an investment in HubSpot means scalable growth without limitations, allowing event planners to create custom objects for venues and speakers, build specialized workflows for different event types, and, most importantly, achieve measurable ROI that justifies marketing spend to big decision-makers. The best email marketing tool for event planning companies depends on your specific event types, audience size, and automation needs. HubSpot’s Marketing Hub consistently ranks as a top choice because it combines robust email marketing with integrated CRM capabilities, event-specific workflows, and comprehensive analytics in one platform. For small event businesses just starting out, HubSpot’s free tools provide email marketing for up to 2,000 sends per month, while growing companies can scale into paid tiers that include advanced features like Breeze AI for subject line optimization and multi-touch attribution reporting. Essential features for event planning email marketing include: Additionally, look for platforms offering: The platform should also provide responsive templates optimized for mobile devices, since many attendees check event emails on smartphones, and real-time analytics to monitor registration pace and adjust promotional strategies accordingly. Yes, HubSpot excels for event planning companies due to its all-in-one approach that eliminates the need for multiple disconnected tools. HubSpot’s Marketing Hub provides event planners with pre-built workflow templates for common event sequences, smart lists that automatically segment attendees based on behavior and attributes, and the ability to create custom objects for tracking venues, speakers, and sponsors beyond standard contact records. Lastly, as previously mentioned, event planning companies like Clearwing have achieved 4,200% ROI using HubSpot's Marketing Hub for conference promotion, demonstrating the platform’s ability to handle complex, multi-faceted event campaigns while providing clear attribution data that proves marketing impact. Email marketing software for event planning typically ranges from free for basic tools to $3,000+ monthly for enterprise solutions. HubSpot offers a free tier with basic email marketing, with paid plans starting at $9/month per seat for Starter and scaling to $800/month for Professional (includes 3 seats). Costs typically increase based on: Event planners should budget for 20 to 30% annual price increases as their contact databases grow and factor in potential savings from consolidating multiple tools into one platform. Most modern email marketing platforms offer native integrations or API connections with popular event ticketing systems, enabling automatic data synchronization between platforms. As mentioned before, HubSpot’s App Marketplace includes pre-built integrations with Eventbrite, Zoom Events, Cvent, and other major ticketing platforms, automatically syncing: These integrations enable powerful automation possibilities — for example, when someone purchases a VIP ticket through Eventbrite, HubSpot can automatically trigger a premium welcome sequence with exclusive content and special venue access instructions. Pro tip: If your ticketing platform doesn’t have a native integration, look for email marketing tools with Zapier connectivity or open APIs that allow custom connections, though these may require technical setup and ongoing maintenance compared to out-of-the-box integrations. HubSpot stands out as the premier email marketing solution for event planning companies by offering enterprise-level automation capabilities at a price point that works for businesses of any size. Unlike traditional event management software that charges per registration or requires expensive custom implementations, HubSpot provides a robust free tier supporting email marketing up to 2,000 sends monthly, making it accessible to solo planners and growing agencies alike. INBOUND, HubSpot’s flagship industry event, achieved 40% conversion rate (CVR) from event page visits to registrations by leveraging LinkedIn ads through HubSpot’s Marketing Hub. All-in-all, HubSpot’s true power lies in its scalability — start free, pay only for what you need, and never outgrow your system as you expand from local workshops to international conferences. With built-in tools for sponsor management, speaker coordination, and attendance analytics, HubSpot eliminates the need for multiple disconnected tools that complicate your workflows and inflate your technology costs.

  Running a cleaning company is about more than mops and elbow grease — it’s about managing relationships, schedules, recurring contracts, field teams, and customer retention. The challenge? CRM needs in the cleaning industry are uniquely demanding. Cleaning businesses juggle high-volume recurring work, on-the-move teams, location-based services, spot‐jobs, and varying customer preferences, all while trying to deliver consistent quality and timely communication.  Generic CRMs often struggle to meet these demands: they lack effective route optimization, mobile crew updates, recurring job automation, and field-to-office synchronization capabilities. That’s where industry-aware CRMs become a solution. A properly configured CRM becomes your operational backbone. It lets you centralize all client touchpoints, automate email reminders and follow-ups, sync field data in real time, track job frequency, and segment communication based on property type or service history. In effect, it turns a cleaning company’s scattered workflows into a streamlined, scalable system. In this article, you’ll get: Before we dive in, it’s worth noting that HubSpot is already used by real cleaning companies to unify their marketing, service, and operations on one platform. Throughout this post, you’ll get clarity on how tools like HubSpot stack up and which options offer the best fit for cleaning business owners in 2025. Table of Contents Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for cleaning businesses is the strategic practice of using automated and personalized email communications to acquire new clients, retain existing customers, and maximize the lifetime value of both residential and commercial cleaning contracts. Unlike general email marketing, cleaning company email strategies focus on: HubSpot’s Marketing Hub enables cleaning businesses to centralize their email marketing with CRM data and service scheduling workflows. Additionally, by connecting email campaigns directly to customer service histories and booking patterns, HubSpot’s Email Marketing Software transforms routine operational messages into revenue-generating touchpoints. This integration means cleaning companies can automatically trigger personalized campaigns based on specific customer behaviors. In the next section, I’ll provide a brief overview of the best email marketing tools for cleaning companies, including pricing for each tool and the features available. CRM Best For Key Features Pricing Free Trial HubSpot (Marketing Hub) Growing cleaning companies that are seeking all-in-one marketing automation with AI-powered optimization Breeze AI for predictive engagement scoring and send time optimization Marketing Hub integration with scheduling and invoicing tools Intelligent segmentation for residential vs. commercial clients Automated review request campaigns Revenue attribution tracking for cleaning services Mobile-optimized booking forms Content Hub for SEO-optimized service pages Free: $0/month/seat Starter: $9/month/seat Professional: $800/month/seat Enterprise: $3,600/month/seat Yes, 14 days Jobber Field service businesses that need integrated scheduling with email marketing Built-in client management for cleaning routes Automated appointment reminders Quote and invoice email automation Service history tracking Two-way calendar sync Customer portal access Individual Plans: Core: $39/month Connect: $89/month Grow: $149/month Team Plans: Connect: $129/month Grow: $249/month Plus: $449/month Yes, 14 days ServiceTitan Large commercial cleaning operations requiring enterprise-level automation Advanced dispatch integration Membership and recurring service campaigns Equipment maintenance reminders Multi-location management Performance analytics dashboard Custom workflow automation Custom pricing only (see here) Yes, 14 days Housecall Pro Residential cleaning services that prioritize ease of use Pre-built cleaning industry templates Instant booking links Before/after photo sharing Automated review invitations Text and email combo campaigns Quick estimate builders Basic: $79/month Essentials: $189/month Max: $329/month Yes, 14 days Mailchimp Budget-conscious cleaning startups focusing on email design Drag-and-drop email builder Basic automation journeys Social media integration Landing page creator A/B testing tools Mobile app management Free: $0/month Essentials: $13/month Standard: $20/month Premium: $350/month Yes, 14 days Constant Contact Cleaning franchises needing multi-account management Industry-specific templates Event management for open houses SMS marketing add-on List segmentation by service type Social media scheduling Real-time reporting Lite: $12/month Standard: $35/month Premium: $80/month Yes, 30 days  Source Best For: Growing cleaning companies that need comprehensive marketing automation with AI-powered customer engagement.

Cleaning businesses, like most service-/client-based companies, often face revenue loss from last-minute cancellations and no-shows, particularly during peak seasons when rebooking slots becomes challenging. Email marketing software addresses this costly problem through automated reminder sequences that trigger at optimal intervals before scheduled services. HubSpot’s Marketing Hub workflow automation allows cleaning companies to set up multi-touch reminder campaigns that: Additionally, HubSpot’s mobile CRM access enables field teams to update appointment status in real-time, automatically triggering rescheduling options for affected customers. Most cleaning companies struggle to promote seasonal services like spring deep-cleaning or holiday prep packages because manually segmenting customers and crafting targeted messages requires hours of administrative work. Modern email marketing platforms solve this challenge by leveraging artificial intelligence to personalize campaigns at scale. HubSpot’s Breeze AI generates customized subject lines and email copy based on individual customer preferences and past service history, while HubSpot's predictive engagement scoring identifies which clients are most likely to book seasonal add-ons, enabling cleaning businesses to focus promotional efforts on high-conversion segments. Cleaning companies often face communication breakdowns when customer interactions are scattered across phone calls, texts, and various email accounts, leading to mishaps like: Email marketing CRMs create a single source of truth for all customer communications. HubSpot’s unified inbox consolidates emails from multiple service areas and team members into one dashboard; its customizable email templates ensure consistent brand messaging, whether communications come from sales, scheduling, or field teams. Additionally, HubSpot’s conversation intelligence tracks all interactions automatically, giving managers complete visibility into customer service quality without manual logging. Without proper tracking, cleaning businesses can’t determine which marketing efforts drive the most valuable contracts, often wasting budget on channels that attract one-time customers rather than recurring commercial accounts. Email marketing software provides detailed analytics that connect marketing activities directly to revenue outcomes. Plus, HubSpot’s revenue attribution models track the complete customer journey from initial email open through contract signing and renewal, while HubSpot’s custom reporting dashboards visualize which email campaigns generate the highest customer lifetime value. This enables cleaning companies to identify that, for instance, commercial property managers acquired through targeted LinkedIn integration campaigns deliver 5x more revenue than residential customers from general promotions. Cleaning businesses know that online reviews drive a large chunk of new customer decisions, yet most struggle to consistently request feedback because manual follow-up requires dedicated staff time they can’t afford. Email marketing automation transforms review collection into a systematic process that runs without intervention. HubSpot’s automated review request workflows trigger personalized emails 24 hours after service completion when satisfaction is highest, while HubSpot’s smart content features dynamically insert the customer’s specific service details and cleaner’s name for a personal touch. Additionally, when integrated with HubSpot’s Service Hub, the system automatically routes four to five star reviewers to public review platforms while directing dissatisfied customers to internal feedback forms, protecting online reputation while capturing valuable service improvement insights. Start by documenting your cleaning company’s entire customer journey from initial inquiry through service delivery and retention. Then, identify every touchpoint where email communication occurs, including: Next, map out which team members handle each communication type and note where manual processes create bottlenecks. For residential cleaning services, this might include a 5-step flow from online booking to post-service review request, while commercial cleaning contracts might require a 12-step process, including RFP responses, site visits, and quarterly business reviews. Document how long each step currently takes and where customers typically drop off to identify automation opportunities. Based on your workflow mapping, create a prioritized list of non-negotiable features your email marketing tool must provide. For cleaning businesses, essential features typically include: Consider operational necessities like: Rank these features by impact on your daily operations. For instance, if 60% of your revenue comes from recurring commercial contracts, automated renewal reminders should top your list. Evaluate how quickly your team can adopt each platform by requesting demos and free trials focused on your specific use cases. Then, test critical workflows with actual team members who’ll use the system daily (i.e., have schedulers create appointment confirmations, field supervisors update job statuses from mobile devices, and office managers run basic reports). Pro tip: Pay attention to training requirements and ongoing support availability, especially during evenings and weekends when cleaning businesses often operate; be sure to consider whether the platform requires dedicated administrators or if team members can self-serve for routine tasks (like updating email templates or pulling performance reports). Calculate the total cost of ownership beyond initial pricing by projecting expenses as your cleaning business grows. Factor in: Also, remember to include hidden expenses (i.e., implementation consultants, ongoing admin support, and time lost to manual workarounds) if the platform lacks critical features. Then, compare this against potential revenue gains from improved customer retention, increased booking rates from automated follow-ups, and time savings from eliminating manual communication tasks. Select an email marketing platform that can grow and adapt with your cleaning business rather than forcing you to switch systems every few years. Look for comprehensive solutions that combine email marketing with CRM, scheduling, and reporting capabilities to avoid the “Frankenstein tech stack” problem many growing businesses face. HubSpot’s extensive platform exemplifies a solution-oriented, unified approach, helping Botkeeper save $100,000 annually. Prior to onboarding its employees onto HubSpot’s CRM, Botkeeper struggled to maintain a plethora of disconnected tools, leaving the business with a more-than-fragmented stack of tools. But with the help of HubSpot’s diverse CRM system (including Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, and Service Hub), Botkeeper was able to migrate 300+ people, including 60+ sales users, as well as deploy three full-time employees (FTE) to do more important, less time-consuming tasks. Botkeeper’s success with HubSpot’s tools proves that an investment in HubSpot isn’t another expense. It’s a revenue multiplier, growth accelerator, and efficiency engine for companies of all sizes. Start by establishing clear objectives for each email campaign based on your cleaning business’s growth priorities. Your goals might include: Segment your contact database into actionable groups: Pro tip: HubSpot’s Marketing Hub enables cleaning businesses to set measurable campaign goals with built-in tracking for conversion rates and revenue attribution. Grow your subscriber base through ethical collection methods that comply with CAN-SPAM regulations while attracting qualified cleaning prospects. Check out some effective list-building strategies for cleaning businesses below: BTW: HubSpot’s form builder creates mobile-responsive intake forms that cleaning companies embed on service pages, quote requests, and booking confirmations. Select email campaign formats that align with where customers are in their relationship with your cleaning service, such as: Remember: Different touchpoints require different messaging strategies to maximize engagement and conversion. Create professional email designs that display correctly across devices. HubSpot’s drag-and-drop email editor provides cleaning businesses with industry-specific templates that automatically adjust for smartphone, tablet, and desktop viewing. If you were wondering what your email template should include, here’s a list quick-hit list of design elements that you should use for any (and all) cleaning company emails: Craft attention-grabbing subject lines that achieve 25 to 35% open rates typical for service businesses while avoiding spam triggers. Here are a few high-performing subject line formulas to get you started: Pro tip: HubSpot’s Breeze AI suggests optimized variations based on cleaning industry benchmarks and recipient behavior patterns. Configure smart automation rules that send the right message at the optimal moment based on customer actions and timing. HubSpot’s workflow builder connects email campaigns with CRM data, ensuring cleaning businesses deliver personalized communications without manual intervention. The following key automation workflows for cleaning companies: Implement A/B testing to continuously improve email performance based on data-driven insights rather than assumptions. If you’re new to A/B email testing, start with HubSpot’s testing tools to measure multiple campaign variables simultaneously. To help you start A/B testing smoothly, these are elements to test for your cleaning company emails: Review campaign analytics to identify top-performing emails that drive bookings and revenue growth. These are the critical metrics for cleaning company email campaigns: Once you’ve identified campaigns that exceed these benchmarks (for at least three consecutive sends), document: Then, replicate these proven formulas across different customer segments and service offerings to maximize your email marketing ROI. Pro tip: HubSpot’s reporting dashboard visualizes key metrics that cleaning businesses need to track ROI and optimize future campaigns. The best email marketing tool for cleaning companies depends on your business size, budget, and specific operational needs. For growing cleaning businesses seeking comprehensive automation, HubSpot’s Email Marketing Software offers the most complete solution with integrated CRM, scheduling workflows, and AI-powered optimization. Pro tip: When choosing your next email marketing tool, select a platform that can automate your unique workflow while providing mobile access for field teams and integration with your existing scheduling tools. Essential features for cleaning company email marketing tools include: These other features are also must-haves: Additionally, advanced features like predictive engagement scoring and dynamic content personalization can significantly improve conversion rates as your cleaning business scales. Yes, HubSpot is particularly well-suited for cleaning companies due to its comprehensive feature set that addresses industry-specific challenges. HubSpot’s Marketing Hub enables cleaning businesses to automate the entire customer lifecycle while maintaining personalized communication at scale. As previously mentioned, the platform’s mobile app allows field teams to access customer information and trigger follow-up sequences from job sites, while Breeze AI helps optimize send times and subject lines for maximum engagement. Plus, the free tier makes it accessible for startups, while enterprise features support multi-location operations with thousands of recurring clients. Email marketing software for cleaning companies ranges from free to $500+ per month depending on features and contact volume. HubSpot’s paid tiers range from $9/month for Starter to $3,600/month for Enterprise-level features. When calculating costs, factor in hidden expenses like: Yes, modern email marketing platforms offer extensive integration capabilities with cleaning-specific software for scheduling, routing, invoicing, and customer management. While HubSpot’s integration ecosystem doesn’t presently connect with popular field service tools like Jobber, ServiceTitan, and Housecall Pro, it does have direct linkages with accounting software including QuickBooks and Xero. Plus, through Zapier or other native APIs, you can connect email campaigns with route optimization tools, payment processors, review management platforms, and even smart home access systems for keyless entry coordination. The right integrations eliminate manual data entry, prevent double-bookings, and ensure consistent communication across all customer touchpoints. HubSpot stands out as the premier email marketing solution for cleaning businesses by offering enterprise-level automation capabilities at price points that work for companies at every growth stage. Unlike traditional field service software that charges per technician or requires costly custom implementations, HubSpot provides a robust free tier, making professional email marketing accessible to solo cleaners and multi-location operations alike. Before adopting HubSpot, SANDOW Design Group, a Florida-based media agency, struggled immensely with navigating a complex tech stack — too many processes, not enough results, and a lack of collaboration and understanding between sales and marketing teams. However, with the help of Marketing Hub, SANDOW Design Group was able to develop a more agile, user-friendly email design experience, resulting in better email marketing communications and 30% growth in B2B subscribers. Moreover, they were also able to reduce email campaign build time by 97% by implementing HubSpot’s drag-and-drop email builder and workflow automation. All-in-all, HubSpot’s true power lies in its scalability — start free with basic email automation, add Marketing Hub as you grow, and integrate Service Hub when you’re ready for advanced customer support features. With built-in tools for route optimization, review management, and revenue attribution reporting, HubSpot eliminates the need for multiple disconnected tools that drain your budget and complicate your operations.

  If you've heard about loop marketing and wondered whether it replaces the inbound methodology you‘ve spent years mastering, I have good news: it doesn’t. Loop marketing builds on inbound‘s foundation, bringing it into the AI era with personalization, multi-channel amplification, and real-time optimization that simply wasn’t possible before.  The question isn‘t ""loop or inbound?"" It’s ""how do I layer loop onto my existing inbound strategy?"" This guide will show you exactly how these frameworks complement each other, how to map loop stages to your current funnel, and how to start implementing loop marketing without throwing away what's already working. Table of Contents Loop Marketing is a new way to grow — powered by humans and AI, working together to express your message, tailor it to your audience, amplify it across channels, and evolve it in real time. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Loop marketing is HubSpot's framework for growth in the AI era. Unlike traditional linear funnels, loop marketing operates as a continuous cycle with four stages: The loop functions as an ongoing system rather than a single campaign. Each cycle contributes to the next, increasing your growth speed over time. Want the full framework? Check out HubSpot's complete Loop Marketing guide. Here's the core difference: inbound marketing focuses on attracting, converting, closing, and delighting customers through valuable content. Loop marketing focuses on expressing, tailoring, amplifying, and evolving that content using unified data and AI. Inbound gave us the playbook for content-first growth when search engines changed how people buy. Loop adapts that playbook for a world where 60% of Google searches now end without a click, where buyers research in ChatGPT before visiting your site, and where traditional lead generation is fundamentally disrupted. Aspect Inbound Marketing Loop Marketing Core Structure Linear funnel (Attract → Convert → Close → Delight) Continuous loop (Express → Tailor → Amplify → Evolve) Primary Focus Creating valuable content to attract customers Personalizing and optimizing content with AI in real-time Distribution Blog-centric, SEO-driven Multi-channel (SEO, AEO, video, communities, creators) Personalization Basic segmentation (e.g., first-name tokens) AI-powered 1:1 personalization using unified CRM data Optimization Post-campaign analysis Real-time iteration and continuous learning Relationship Foundation Evolution that builds on inbound principles What stays the same: What changes: Loop doesn't replace inbound — it modernizes it. Consider inbound as your foundation and loop as the engine for success in an AI-driven world. You don't need to tear down your inbound infrastructure to adopt loop marketing. Your existing blogs, lead magnets, emails, and landing pages remain valuable. Loop simply wraps AI-enabled personalization, multi-channel distribution, and continuous optimization around these assets. Here's what you need before you start: Once these prerequisites are in place, you can start applying loop principles to your existing inbound assets. Take that evergreen blog post and use AI to create personalized versions for different industries. Repurpose your webinar into short-form video clips optimized for social platforms. Set up real-time engagement monitoring instead of waiting for monthly reports. Tools like Breeze AI and Marketing Hub make this layering process substantially easier by giving you AI assistance that already knows your business context. Loop marketing's four stages align naturally with inbound's customer journey, creating clear entry points for implementation: Your Express stage defines the authentic brand voice and audience insights that power your Attract efforts. Tailor takes your expressed brand identity and makes it personal to each prospect. This maps directly to converting visitors and closing deals. Amplify extends your reach beyond traditional inbound channels while maintaining authentic connection. Evolve transforms the traditional “delight” stage into continuous optimization across the entire customer journey. The beauty of this mapping is that you can start with one stage based on your current bottleneck. Struggling with generic content? Focus on Express. Low conversion rates? Start with Tailor. Traffic declining? Prioritize Amplify. Can't move fast enough? Begin with Evolve. Loop Marketing is a new way to grow — powered by humans and AI, working together to express your message, tailor it to your audience, amplify it across channels, and evolve it in real time.

Traditional inbound metrics still matter, but loop marketing introduces new measurements that reflect AI-era growth: Metric Category Inbound Marketing Loop Marketing Key Difference Traffic & Awareness Website traffic, blog visits, organic search rankings Multi-channel traffic (blog, YouTube, podcast, Reddit), AI visibility, brand mentions in LLM responses Loop diversifies beyond owned channels and measures AI engine presence Conversion Visitor-to-lead rate, form fills, content downloads Conversion rate by channel and segment, personalized engagement rate, AI-referred conversion Loop tracks personalization effectiveness and segment-specific performance Lead Quality MQL/SQL counts, lead scoring Intent-based segmentation, behavioral signals, AI-enriched lead data Loop uses real-time signals and AI enrichment for deeper qualification Content Performance Page views, time on page, bounce rate, social shares Content velocity (time to publish), cost per asset, AEO citations, repurpose rate Loop measures creation efficiency and cross-channel amplification Optimization A/B test results (post-campaign), campaign ROI Experiments per month, loop velocity, real-time performance alerts, learning rate Loop emphasizes continuous testing speed over post-mortem analysis Customer Journey Funnel stage conversion rates, days to close Path analysis across touchpoints, drop-off identification, journey optimization rate Loop maps non-linear journeys and identifies real-time friction points Business Impact Cost per lead, CAC, marketing-influenced revenue CAC by channel, AI-referred customer value, compound loop improvement Loop attributes value to new channels and measures velocity gains The shift here is from static reporting to dynamic optimization. You‘re not just measuring what happened — you’re measuring how fast you're learning and adapting. According to research from Semrush, AI-referred traffic converts 4.4x better than traditional search traffic because these visitors arrive with higher intent. That makes AI visibility metrics particularly valuable for understanding where your growth will come from next. Even experienced inbound marketers hit obstacles when adopting loop marketing. Here are the most common traps and how to avoid them: Fix: Start with one loop cycle focused on a specific challenge (like email conversion), then expand. Loop is a operating system, not a one-time project. Fix: Document your brand style guide first. Never let AI generate content without human review until you've validated output quality consistently over multiple cycles. Fix: Clean up duplicate contacts, standardize field values, and consolidate your tech stack before scaling personalization. Bad data creates bad experiences no matter how sophisticated your AI. Fix: Track metrics at every loop stage. Amplify without Evolve means you‘re distributing content without learning from it. Express without Tailor means you’ve defined your brand but haven't made it personal. Fix: Loop requires cross-functional collaboration. Content, demand gen, marketing ops, and sales must work together. Appoint a “loop owner” who coordinates across teams rather than letting each function optimize their piece in isolation. Fix: Answer Engine Optimization complements SEO, it doesn't replace it. Use the AI Search Grader to understand how you're performing in both traditional and AI search, then optimize for both. Fix: Loop marketing compounds over time. Your first cycle might feel awkward. By cycle three, you‘ll start seeing velocity. By cycle ten, you’ll have a compounding advantage competitors can't match. The teams that succeed with loop marketing treat it as a long-term capability build, not a quick win. They invest in foundations (unified data, brand documentation, measurement frameworks) before scaling tactics. No. Loop marketing modernizes inbound for the AI era while preserving its customer-first principles. Inbound taught us to attract with valuable content, convert with trust, close with alignment, and delight with exceptional experiences. Loop keeps all of that and adds AI-powered personalization, multi-channel amplification, and continuous optimization. Think of inbound as your foundation and loop as the engine that makes it work when buyers research in ChatGPT, discover brands on TikTok, and expect every interaction to feel personally relevant. Start by identifying your current bottleneck—is it traffic, conversion, or retention? Then pilot the corresponding loop stage: Map your existing inbound assets to loop stages: blogs and SEO content support Express and Amplify; lead magnets and landing pages fit Tailor; analytics and A/B testing live in Evolve. Layer new loop capabilities onto these existing assets rather than rebuilding from scratch. Start with loop velocity; how many experiments or iterations you complete per month. This single metric captures whether you're truly embracing continuous improvement or just rebranding traditional campaigns as ""loop marketing."" Add one metric per stage as you mature: These metrics give you early signals of loop adoption without overwhelming your analytics infrastructure. Begin with a lightweight cleanse focused on your highest-value segments. Consolidate duplicate contacts, standardize critical fields (industry, company size, lifecycle stage), and ensure your CRM connects to your email, website, and advertising platforms. You don't need perfect data to start; you need good enough data on your best customers. Use Smart CRM to enrich contact records as people engage with your content automatically. Then pilot personalization on one high-impact page or email sequence. Measure the lift. Use that proof point to justify deeper data investment.  The loop marketing framework is platform-agnostic. You can apply Express, Tailor, Amplify, and Evolve principles with any marketing stack. However, HubSpot‘s unified platform makes implementation substantially easier because your CRM, content creation, email marketing, advertising, and analytics already work together. Breeze AI knows your business context automatically. Personalization doesn’t require custom development. AEO optimization tools are built in. You spend time on strategy and execution instead of duct-taping systems together. If you're evaluating whether to implement loop with your current stack or migrate to HubSpot's Marketing Hub, ask yourself: how much time does my team spend on integration maintenance versus strategic work? Loop is possible anywhere, but it's dramatically faster on a unified platform. Loop marketing doesn‘t ask you to abandon what’s working. It asks you to evolve. Take the inbound foundation you've built and layer on AI-powered personalization, multi-channel amplification, and real-time optimization. Start with one loop cycle. Pick your biggest bottleneck and apply the framework there. Measure the lift. Then expand. The teams winning in the AI era aren‘t the ones with the most sophisticated technology. They’re the ones cycling through Express, Tailor, Amplify, and Evolve faster than their competitors can plan a quarterly campaign. Ready to get started? Check out the Loop Marketing Playbook for step-by-step implementation guidance, or explore how Breeze AI can accelerate your first loop cycle. Loop Marketing is a new way to grow — powered by humans and AI, working together to express your message, tailor it to your audience, amplify it across channels, and evolve it in real time.

  If you think balancing your content calendar and your Monday meetings is too much, imagine if you also had to factor in superstition, literal witch trials, and being a magical mecca for millions. But it’s not all black cats and broomsticks. Today’s master oversees year-round tourism marketing for one of the US’s oldest and most history-rich towns — and also one of the largest Halloween destinations in the world.  As things start to look spoOoOoky in SEO and social marketing, Ashley Judge is finding scary good success with owned media. “Which doesn’t feel sexy in 2025, but it is,” Judge says. (Note to self: Sexy Marketing Channel costume?) “Algorithms change, but emails let us tell our stories and connect to our people.” The key, she says, is finding the right mindset. “It’s not a hard sell pitch. It’s just, ‘Hi! Remember us?’” To illustrate her point, imagine being on the email list for a local arcade. If your inbox is constantly full of ads, you’re gonna send them straight to spam hell. But if they just send a little hello and maybe some free tokens… “If it’s on a day when you don’t want to go to an arcade, you just won’t go to an arcade. But you’re not likely to be offended by a ‘Hi! Remember us?’ campaign.” “And then, one day, it’s a Tuesday and you’re bored and you get an email from the arcade, so you go in. But that can’t happen if you’re not emailing them.” To find that mindset, Judge recommends imagining you’re sending the message to a friend. “What would the accompanying text be if I screenshot this and sent it to one of my friends? It would be very weird if they got a text from Ashley that said ‘THIS JUST IN!’ But my friends aren’t going to block me if I say ‘Wouldn’t this be fun?’” What would you do if you were expecting over 1 million visitors, but only had 3,000 parking spots available? Personally, I’d curl into a ball and cry. But Judge had a better idea: Convince them to take the train. So she scooped up a dozen of Salem’s many colorful street performers and whipped up a campaign around riding Salem’s public transportation. “In every facet of marketing, there’s always an opportunity to remove barriers. We’re answering business and customer service challenges.”  Photo credit: Jessica Shada Analyzing the problems that exist along your customer journey is a great way to inspire useful marketing content and boost your metrics. “When you have millions of eyeballs, any small barrier to conversion could be the loss of thousands of orders. A really small example: a pamphlet that’s been distributed to motor coaches for years, that was meant to be a trifold, that got uploaded as a PDF. Who wants to read an upside-down PDF?” If you’re not sure what haunts your audience, I bet your Sales and CS teams have a clue. And you’ll be their new best friend if you ask them. “When I worked in ecommerce, we focused on personas like ‘The Bestie,’ or ‘The Bird Lover,’ or ‘The Sweary Friend.’ These hyper-specific profiles made our marketing feel like you were talking to one person at a time.’” Now, specific personas as a concept may not be new, but Destination Salem raises it to an artform. Faced with the challenge of a very broad audience with very diverse interests, Judge and her team needed a way to very quickly talk to many different people. So they magicked up a ’90s Cosmo-style quiz that sorts you into personas like Cultural Connoisseur or Epicurean Explorer. “Our biggest group, for example, is what we call ‘Muggles Seeking Magic.’ They’re not part of modern witch culture, nor are they history buffs, but they’re seeking tarot, aura photos, and spell shops.” The quiz then offers viewers personalized suggestions and the chance to create a custom itinerary. But it also doubles as a data collection tool, which allows Judge to better understand who is visiting Salem and why. “It’s about starting with the broadest umbrella, and then pointing them to the places that are best for them.” And, if you’re burning with curiosity, I’m an Atlas Obscura Enthusiast. Every leader must justify marketing and brand investment with hard numbers. How do you functionally bridge the gap between creative, intangible brand value and tangible financial outcomes, and how do you justify that brand investment to key stakeholders? — Katie Miserany, Chief Communications Officer and SVP of Marketing, SurveyMonkey Judge says: In destination marketing, our work sits between numbers and imagination. We’re here to drive economic value for residents and small businesses, so we measure everything: visitation, spending, seasonality, excise tax. But the way we get there is by creating a bit of fantasy. People don’t visit because of data; they visit because they’ve been pulled into a story about a place. Our creative work builds that story, and when it works, you can see it in the numbers that follow. Judge asks: What’s something your team does purely out of love for the user — not metrics, not growth, just because it feels right?

  Nonprofit organizations face limited staff and budgets, but they still need to personalize donor communications at scale, segment audiences based on giving behavior, maintain engagement between campaigns, and track the full donor journey from first contact to recurring supporter. Email marketing software addresses these challenges by automating donor segmentation, personalizing communications without manual effort, tracking engagement across the donor lifecycle, and centralizing donor data in one platform.  This article compares the best email marketing tools for nonprofit organizations in 2025. You'll find a comparison table of top platforms, detailed feature breakdowns for each tool, guidance on selecting the right software for your organization, step-by-step instructions for creating effective nonprofit email campaigns, and answers to frequently asked questions about nonprofit email marketing. To bring you this comprehensive guide, we used AI for research and drafting, and a HubSpot staff writer reviewed and revised the article before publication. The median email open rate for nonprofits in 2024 was 53.21% — much higher than the median across all industries of 42.35% (data from MailerLite). Organizations like Greater Good Charities use HubSpot Marketing Hub to increase email open rates and decrease bounce rates while scaling personalized engagement to reach supporters with tailored messages across channels. Table of Contents Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for nonprofits is the practice of using email communications to build relationships with donors, volunteers, and supporters while driving fundraising and mission engagement. Nonprofits use email marketing to share impact stories, send donation appeals, recruit volunteers, promote events, and maintain ongoing supporter relationships. Effective nonprofit email marketing segments audiences based on giving history and engagement levels to deliver personalized messages that inspire action and build long-term loyalty. HubSpot Marketing Hub enables nonprofits to scale personalized email engagement and reach each supporter with the right message at the right time.

Organizations can send targeted appeals to major donors, first-time givers, or lapsed supporters without manually sorting contact lists before each campaign. Platforms track open rates, click-through rates, and donation conversions for each email sent. Nonprofits can identify which subject lines, content types, and send times generate the most engagement without compiling data from multiple sources. Email campaigns eliminate printing, postage, and fulfillment expenses associated with physical mailings. Organizations sending monthly updates can reach thousands of supporters for a fraction of direct mail costs while maintaining regular communication frequency. Email marketing platforms can store supporter contact information, communication preferences, and engagement history in one system. Teams can access complete donor communication records without searching through multiple spreadsheets or email accounts. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Document your current email sending patterns, including donation acknowledgments, monthly newsletters, fundraising appeals, event invitations, and volunteer recruitment messages. Identify which communications are one-time sends versus automated sequences triggered by supporter actions. Determine which features are essential versus nice-to-have based on your workflows. Nonprofits typically require automation capabilities, donor segmentation, donation platform integrations, and campaign analytics at minimum. Organizations with technical staff may prioritize API access while smaller teams need intuitive visual editors. Evaluate whether your team has dedicated marketing staff or relies on volunteers and part-time employees. Platforms with drag-and-drop editors, pre-built templates, and simple automation builders reduce the technical expertise required. Test free trials to assess whether your team can execute campaigns without extensive training. Calculate costs based on your current contact list size and projected growth over 12 to 24 months. Some platforms charge per contact while others charge per email sent. Factor in nonprofit discounts. HubSpot offers 40% off for qualifying nonprofit organizations. Select software that integrates with your existing donation platform and CRM to maintain unified supporter records. Greater Good Charities uses HubSpot Marketing Hub to increase email open rates and decrease bounce rates while scaling personalized engagement across its donor base. Subject lines can be tricky. You’re looking for a short phrase that communicates your intent while retaining your non-profit’s unique voice. An interesting subject line should include the following elements. An amazing nonprofit newsletter should include the latest and greatest from your organization. Inform your recipients of recent goals reached, heartwarming stories of those you help, life updates of staff and volunteers, and anything else of note. Pro tip: To make your emails visually interesting, take pictures during events to include in your newsletters. With permission, include the names of the volunteers pictured and describe what activities took place. Your cause is near and dear to those who subscribe to your newsletter. Their time spent volunteering and money donated should always be received with a spirit of gratitude. Let email recipients know the immediate impact of their donations with interesting data points. For example, “Your donation helped x number of families” or “Your volunteer efforts fed x number of children.” Pro tip: Some of your newsletter recipients will be more involved than others. Consider opening the line of communication with these donors by sending a personalized, non-automated email that references their specific efforts to the cause. A call-to-action (CTA) is an invitation to your audience to do something. In an email or newsletter, your CTA should be a button that links to the action you want recipients to take next. Examples of CTAs for your nonprofit email could be “Subscribe to the newsletter,” “Donate now,” “Refer a friend,” or more. Don’t be afraid to get creative with your CTAs, and be sure to measure your conversion rate. Pro tip: There are lots of CTA tools you can use to make linking to the next step easier. Explore common options here.

  Property management companies are tasked with marketing to multiple distinct audiences simultaneously. While prospective tenants need nurture campaigns showcasing available units, property owners expect market insights and portfolio performance updates — all requiring different messaging, timing, and tone. Email marketing tools for property management solve this multi-audience marketing challenge through advanced segmentation and automation that keep communications organized and effective. But how do you know which tool is the best for your unique business?  In this article, we'll compare the best email marketing tools for property managers, including a comparison table, detailed feature breakdowns, a step-by-step selection guide, and answers to frequently asked questions. To bring you this comprehensive guide, we used AI for research and drafting, and a HubSpot staff writer reviewed and revised this article before publication. Real property management companies like APM Property Management are already seeing results: APM eliminated manual work by using HubSpot to implement one-click email sending to tenants. Table of Contents Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for property management is the strategic use of campaigns and automated messaging to market to multiple distinct audiences — property owners, prospective tenants, current tenants, and potential property owner clients. These tools handle marketing communications like owner newsletters featuring market trends, tenant community updates promoting amenities and events, and nurture sequences for prospective renters, through advanced segmentation and automation. Platforms like HubSpot Marketing Hub centralize these multi-audience marketing communications, allowing property managers to reach targeted groups with one click while tracking engagement across the entire lifecycle.

Source Best For: Visually appealing marketing emails based on prebuilt templates Key Mailchimp Features: Mailchimp Pricing:  Source Best For: User-friendly email marketing platform for focusing on event marketing for community events and property tours Key Constant Contact Features: Constant Contact Pricing: Email marketing platforms automate repetitive marketing tasks like monthly owner newsletters, tenant community updates, and prospective tenant nurture sequences that property managers traditionally handle manually. Instead of copying contact lists into BCC fields or managing multiple Excel spreadsheets across teams, automation ensures consistent, timely delivery of marketing communications. Property management requires simultaneously marketing to property owners, prospective tenants, current tenants, and potential owner clients. Email marketing tools solve this complexity through advanced segmentation that ensures each audience receives relevant marketing messaging — preventing the confusion of owners receiving tenant-focused community updates or prospects getting newsletters meant for current residents. Disparate systems and siloed spreadsheets create version control issues where one team‘s contact updates don’t reach others, leading to delivery failures and outdated information. Email marketing platforms provide a single source of truth for all contact data, enabling team members across multiple properties or locations to access current information, view engagement history, and coordinate communications without manual syncing or duplicate data entry. Managing 50 units requires different tools than managing 500 units, and property management companies need platforms that grow with their business. Email marketing software handles increasing contact volumes, automated workflow complexity, and multi-property operations without requiring proportional increases in administrative staff — allowing companies to expand their portfolios while maintaining consistent communication quality across all properties. Smaller property management companies often lack dedicated marketing staff but still need to send polished owner reports, branded newsletters, and professional tenant communications. Email marketing platforms provide pre-built templates, drag-and-drop editors, and AI content generation that enable teams to create visually appealing, on-brand emails quickly. This helps PMs maintain a professional image that builds trust with property owners and differentiates the company from competitors. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Selecting the right email marketing tool requires more than comparing feature lists. Property management companies need platforms that handle multiple audiences, scale with portfolio growth, and integrate with existing systems. Follow this framework to find the platform that fits your workflow. Document all the different groups you market to: property owners (market analysis, portfolio updates), prospective tenants (available units, neighborhood guides), current tenants (community events, amenity promotions), and potential owner clients (thought leadership, market insights). List all your regular marketing communications and identify which could be automated versus which need manual personalization to reveal the complexity your email marketing tool must handle. Your email marketing tool must connect to your property management system (Buildium, AppFolio, or Propertyware) and CRM through direct integrations or API access to sync contact data. Evaluate whether it can trigger marketing emails based on prospect actions like downloading content, attending tours, or reaching specific engagement thresholds and automatically move contacts between marketing segments as their status changes. Request demos or trial periods and involve multiple team members, including leasing agents, property managers, and office administrators, in the evaluation to ensure the platform feels intuitive for all skill levels. Look for drag-and-drop editors, pre-built templates, and clear navigation that reduce the learning curve. Calculate costs based on your projected contact volume in 12 to 24 months, not just your current list size, since many platforms charge per contact. Factor in additional expenses for SMS messaging, advanced automation, API access, and transactional emails if needed. Accommodation.co.uk eliminated manual processes by centralizing communications in HubSpot, growing from 35 monthly landlord leads to over 1,200 while automating 92% of its lettings process through 150+ email and SMS communications across 12 different pipelines. A unified system like HubSpot Marketing Hub allows you to trigger targeted campaigns based on actual tenant and owner behavior tracked in the same CRM. Create separate contact lists for each audience type: current tenants, property owners, prospective renters, and potential property owner clients. Within each list, add segmentation criteria like property type (single-family, multi-family, commercial), geographic market, investment portfolio size, or engagement level. This segmentation ensures owner newsletters highlight relevant market data while tenant community updates focus on local events and amenity promotions. Establish specific marketing objectives for each audience. For property owners, track newsletter open rates, referral generation, and contract renewals. For prospective tenants, monitor newsletter opens and tour booking rates. For potential owner clients, measure consultation requests and content downloads. Setting clear KPIs helps measure whether your marketing content resonates with each audience. Develop email marketing campaigns tailored to each audience's interests. Build monthly newsletters for property owners featuring market trends, occupancy rates, and investment insights. Create community newsletters for tenants highlighting upcoming events, local business spotlights, and amenity promotions. Design nurture sequences for prospective tenants showcasing available units, neighborhood guides, and move-in specials. Integrate with a CRM to centralize contact data and track all marketing interactions in one place. Platforms like HubSpot's Marketing Hub provide unified systems that combine email marketing with contact management, enabling you to see who opened newsletters, track engagement history, and trigger automated campaigns based on when someone downloads content or attends a property tour. Split test subject lines and content to see what really drives results. Property owners may respond better to data-driven headlines (“Seattle Rental Market: Rents Up 7% in Q4”), while prospective tenants may prefer more lifestyle-focused messaging (“Discover Your New Neighborhood”). Test email content formats; some audiences prefer text-heavy market analysis while others respond to visual property showcases. Monitor open rates, click-through rates, and conversion metrics for each campaign and audience segment. Track which newsletter topics drive the most engagement from owners, which community updates generate the most interaction from tenants, and which property showcases generate tour requests. Pay attention to unsubscribe rates to ensure your marketing content remains valuable and relevant. Use your analytics to optimize future marketing campaigns. If owner newsletters featuring local market data get higher engagement than general industry trends, increase localization. If tenant newsletters sent mid-week outperform weekend sends, adjust your schedule. Continuously test new content types, formats, and approaches to improve engagement across all audience segments. HubSpot Marketing Hub is the best email marketing tool for property management because it centralizes CRM, email marketing, and automation in one platform. Accommodation.co.uk grew from 35 monthly landlord leads to over 1,200 while automating 92% of its lettings process using HubSpot. The platform allows property managers to trigger campaigns based on behavior tracked in the same CRM, eliminating data syncing between separate tools. Other strong options include ActiveCampaign for advanced automation, Zoho Campaigns for budget-conscious teams, and Mailchimp for template-based campaigns. Property management email marketing tools need advanced segmentation to separate marketing communications for tenants, property owners, prospects, and potential owner clients, plus marketing automation that triggers campaigns based on prospect actions like content downloads, tour attendance, or engagement milestones. Integration with property management systems is essential for syncing contact data and eliminating manual entry. Other critical features include SMS capabilities for time-sensitive marketing reminders, centralized contact management, mobile access, analytics to demonstrate ROI, and drag-and-drop editors with pre-built templates. Yes, HubSpot is excellent for property management because it unifies email marketing, CRM, and operations data in one platform. APM Property Management eliminated manual work by using HubSpot to implement one-click email sending to tenants while consolidating contact data previously scattered across Excel spreadsheets. HubSpot allows property managers to create automated campaigns triggered by events like tour bookings and segment audiences for targeted messaging. Email marketing software for property management ranges from free plans to $3,600+ per month depending on contact volume and features. Free options include HubSpot Marketing Hub (up to 2 users), Zoho Campaigns (up to 2,000 contacts), and Mailchimp (1,000 monthly sends). Entry-level paid plans start at $4-$19/month for 500-1,000 contacts. Most platforms charge per contact, so calculate costs based on your projected growth in 12 to 24 months rather than current list size. Yes, many email marketing tools can integrate with property management software, but you need to consider what type of integration you want. API integrations require more work than native integrations, for example. If you’re hoping for native integrations with your existing software, you need to carefully read each email marketing tool’s documentation or contact their sales reps. LeadSimple has a native integration with Mailchimp, so if you’re looking for easy syncing with an email marketing platform, and you already use LeadSimple, then Mailchimp makes sense. However, many email marketing platforms have APIs you can use to set up your own integration with pretty much any software. HubSpot has an integrations library of over 1,900 apps, as well as an API with extensive documentation. Property management companies need email marketing tools that handle multiple audiences, scale with portfolio growth, and eliminate manual workflows. HubSpot Marketing Hub delivers all three through a unified CRM platform that combines email marketing, automation, and operations data in one system. Key HubSpot Marketing Hub Features for Property Management: Real property management companies are seeing measurable results with HubSpot. Accommodation.co.uk increased tenant inquiry conversion from 18% to 53% using HubSpot's centralized platform. Real estate tech company Wahi saves time by automating follow-up emails through HubSpot Marketing Hub. Ready to streamline communications for your property management business?

  As an ecommerce business, you’re managing a catalog of products with constantly changing inventory, coordinating time-sensitive seasonal campaigns around Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and competing for attention in crowded inboxes teeming with promotional emails. How do you win back shoppers who add items but never complete their purchase? Email marketing software solves these challenges by automating cart recovery sequences, segmenting customers based on purchase patterns, and personalizing product recommendations at scale. The payoff is huge: Ecommerce has the highest email marketing ROI of any industry: $45 for every $1 spent, according to data from Litmus. Ecommerce company Spocket doubled its conversion rate with the help of HubSpot Marketing Hub email sequences and workflow automation. But getting ROI like that requires the right email marketing tools. This guide will compare the top seven email marketing tools for ecommerce businesses, including detailed pricing, feature breakdowns, and step-by-step guidance on choosing the right platform. We used AI for research and drafting, led by a HubSpot staff writer who reviewed and revised this article before publication.  Table of Contents Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for ecommerce involves sending targeted email campaigns to customers and prospects to drive product sales, recover abandoned carts, and increase repeat purchases. Online stores use email marketing software to automate personalized messages triggered by shopping behaviors like browsing products, adding items to cart, or completing purchases, turning one-time buyers into loyal, repeat customers.

Plans are as follows: Recover lost revenue with automated emails that encourage customers to come back and complete their purchases. B2C businesses can connect their store to HubSpot to automate abandoned cart emails. With an analytics dashboard, you can see opens, clicks, conversions, and which products drove the most conversions. HubSpot Marketing Hub has advanced marketing reporting, allowing you to connect email campaigns to revenue outcomes. Email marketing software segments customers based on purchase history, browsing behavior, and engagement patterns, automatically sending relevant product recommendations and personalized content to each segment. Because Marketing Hub is built on HubSpot Smart CRM, you can use customer data to power your email campaigns. HubSpot’s personalization tokens and dynamic content ensure that every email feels tailor-made to the audience segment. Automated drip campaigns keep your brand top of mind for customers long after their first purchase, nurturing relationships and encouraging repeat orders over time. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. List every customer touchpoint where email plays a role, from welcome sequences and abandoned cart recovery to post-purchase follow-ups and win-back campaigns. Understanding your existing customer journey helps you identify which automation capabilities you‘ll actually use versus nice-to-have features you’ll pay for but never implement. Determine which ecommerce platform, payment processor, and other tools your email marketing software must connect with to sync customer data automatically. Native integrations with your existing tech stack (like Shopify, WooCommerce, or BigCommerce) eliminate manual data entry and ensure your email campaigns use real-time purchase and browsing behavior. Test how easily you can create segments based on purchase history, browsing behavior, and customer value, then build automated workflows triggered by specific ecommerce events. The right platform should let you set up abandoned cart sequences, product recommendation emails, and customer lifecycle campaigns without requiring developer resources. Calculate costs at your current contact count, then project what you'll pay when your list doubles or triples as your business grows. Many email marketing tools seem affordable at 1,000 contacts but become prohibitively expensive at 10,000 or 50,000 contacts, so understanding long-term costs prevents budget surprises. Select an email marketing tool that can handle increasing complexity as you expand from basic newsletters to sophisticated multi-channel campaigns with advanced segmentation and attribution tracking. Watchmaker CODE41 sends 2.5 million emails per month using HubSpot's Email Marketing tool to manage their community of half a million supporters with advanced list segmentation that improved conversions. Decide what you want each campaign to achieve, whether it's driving product sales, recovering abandoned carts, increasing repeat purchases, or growing your email list. Set specific metrics to track success, such as conversion rate, revenue per email, click-through rate, or average order value. Plan email campaigns around major shopping seasons like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, holiday gift guides, and back-to-school periods when customers are actively looking to purchase. Schedule promotional emails, product launches, and exclusive offers to align with these high-intent buying windows. Nurturing your list year-round helps keep cash flow strong even when Black Friday has come and gone. Create evergreen automated workflows that run continuously, such as welcome series for new subscribers and win-back campaigns for lapsed customers. Group customers by purchase history, browsing activity, customer lifetime value, and engagement levels to send more relevant product recommendations and offers to each segment. Ensure you have proper opt-in consent. Test different subject lines, email designs, product placements, call-to-action buttons, and send times to identify what resonates best with your audience. Start with simple tests comparing two variations, then expand to multivariate testing as you gather more data. Review your email analytics dashboard to see which campaigns drove the most revenue, which products performed best, and where customers dropped off. Use these insights to refine your segmentation, adjust your messaging, improve your product recommendations, and repeat successful patterns in future campaigns. The best email marketing tool for ecommerce depends on your business size, budget, and specific needs. HubSpot Marketing Hub is the top choice for businesses wanting unified marketing, sales, and service tools with native ecommerce integrations, advanced automation, and revenue attribution reporting. Klaviyo excels for businesses prioritizing email + SMS optimization with predictive analytics, while Zoho Campaigns offers the most affordable option for businesses already using the Zoho ecosystem. For budget-conscious startups, MailerLite provides strong deliverability and ecommerce automation templates starting at just $10/month.

  If you run or market a consulting firm, you already know email isn’t just a channel — it’s your relationship lifeline.  Your prospects don’t buy impulsively; they engage and evaluate your thought leadership, collaboration, and expertise for months. That’s why email marketing for consulting firms differs from that of B2C or e-commerce companies. You manage long sales cycles, high-value deals, and multiple stakeholders. Without the right email tools, staying top of mind can turn into a manual grind of segmenting contacts by industry, sending follow-ups, syncing data between CRMs, and tracking which campaigns actually influenced revenue. The right email marketing software simplifies all of that. This article will share the best email marketing tools for consulting firms, including HubSpot. (And not to brag, but companies have used HubSpot’s AI-powered email personalization to increase conversions by 82%.) Table of Contents Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for consulting firms is arguably more focused on nurturing relationships than other industries, not just blasting promotions. Unlike retail businesses that see immediate purchases, consulting firms use email to educate decision-makers, demonstrate thought leadership, and stay top-of-mind during lengthy evaluation processes. You can deliver case studies, industry insights, and personalized follow-ups that position your firm as the trusted advisor prospects turn to when they're ready to move forward. The right email marketing tool helps you replace these manual follow-ups with structured, intelligent workflows that save time and build trust. Email Marketing Tool Best For Key Features Pricing* Free Trial HubSpot Marketing Hub Full-service firms needing CRM + marketing Deal-linked workflows, AI personalization, analytics Free plan. Paid starts ~$9/mo; scales to Pro/Enterprise Yes Audienceful Thought leadership content Document-style editor, minimalist design, lead magnets Custom Contact for demo ActiveCampaign Small to mid-size firms seeking automation-first Conditional logic, tagging, CRM sync From ~$15/mo (1,000 contacts) 14 days MailerLite Solo consultants and small firms Simple UI, landing pages, automations Free up to 1,000 contacts; paid from ~$9/mo Yes Brevo (Sendinblue) Multi-channel outreach (email + SMS) Email + SMS + chat Free plan available; paid starts at ~$8/mo Yes Klaviyo Data-heavy firms needing deep segmentation Analytics, attribution, scalability Free plan. Paid starts at $45/mo Yes *Pricing reflects Q4 2025. Check vendor sites for the latest updates. Choosing the right email marketing platform can transform how your consulting firm attracts and converts clients. Here are the top solutions built for professional services. If you want to connect every email touchpoint directly to your pipeline, HubSpot is built for you. It combines CRM, marketing automation, and analytics in one platform, so you never have to switch tabs to see how an email influenced a deal.  Source Best For: Consulting teams that want unified marketing, sales, and service data. Why It Works for You: Pricing: Free Plan. Paid plans start around $9/mo/seat for basic email tools. Learn more. Designed specifically for consultancies, Audienceful streamlines client engagement, inbound marketing, and prospect nurturing with a minimalist interface focused on content over design complexity. This is made clear by its document-style editor, which makes newsletters feel like personal correspondence rather than corporate broadcasts.  Source The platform emphasizes building valuable email lists through lead magnets and targeted campaigns that showcase expertise in specific industries or functions. Its simplicity makes it ideal for consultants who want to focus on writing great content rather than wrestling with complex design tools. Best For: Solo consultants and small firms focused on thought leadership and content-driven email marketing with minimal design complexity. Key Audienceful Features: Audienceful Pricing: Learn more If you want sophisticated automation at an approachable price, ActiveCampaign is a strong pick. With over 950 pre-built automation templates and machine learning capabilities, it's ideal for consulting firms ready to scale their outreach without adding headcount.  Source Best For: Mid-sized consulting firms that need enterprise-grade automation and segmentation capabilities without enterprise pricing. Why It Works for You: Pricing: Starts at $15/month for 1,000 contacts (10x email send limit). Learn more. If simplicity and ease matter more than depth, MailerLite helps you move fast without the clutter. Founded by over 130 designers and developers focused on “keeping it simple,” MailerLite proves that affordable doesn‘t mean limited, offering landing pages, automation, and e-commerce integrations at a fraction of competitors’ costs.  Source Best For: Solo consultants or small firms getting started with email marketing. Why It Works for You: Pricing: Learn more Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Brevo stands out with its unique pay-per-email pricing model rather than charging based on contact count. This makes it exceptionally cost-effective for consulting firms with large databases but moderate sending needs.  Source Best For: Firms that want multi-channel client communication. Why It Works for You: Pricing: Free plan available up to 300 emails/month. Paid plans starting at $8.08/month with Brevo branding. Learn more. Klaviyo is best known in B2C e-commerce circles. Still, many of its strengths — especially around segmentation, analytics, and data-driven triggers — can be adapted to a consulting context when you have rich behavioral data or want to adopt more advanced targeting.  Source Best For: Consultancies with stronger analytics or data teams, or firms that already have event / behavior tracking (e.g. pattern of site visits, content consumption) and want to bring that behavioral depth into email. Why It Works for You: Pricing: Free plan up to 500 emails/month. Paid plans start at $45/month. Learn more. The right email marketing platform solves common challenges that consulting firms face when trying to grow their client base while delivering excellent service. Here's how email marketing software directly addresses these pain points. Consulting sales cycles often span 3-12 months as prospects evaluate options, secure budget, and build internal consensus. Manual follow-up at this scale is impossible. Email automation ensures prospects receive timely, relevant content throughout their journey without requiring your team to remember every touchpoint. HubSpot's workflows let you create sophisticated nurture sequences that adapt based on prospect behavior. Send industry-specific case studies to engaged leads, reactivation campaigns to dormant contacts, and educational content to early-stage prospects — all automatically.  Source Generic email blasts don't work for consulting firms. Decision-makers expect communications that speak directly to their industry, role, and specific challenges. Email marketing software enables precise segmentation based on company size, industry, pain points, and engagement level, which lets you tailor your message to make it more relevant. With HubSpot's smart lists and segmentation, you can create dynamic segments that automatically update as prospects engage with your content. Send CFOs content about financial optimization while COOs receive operational efficiency resources—all from the same platform. Its personalization tokens and smart content let you take this further, adjusting the messaging to speak specifically to the recipient based on CRM data. When marketing and sales operate in separate systems, leads fall through the cracks, and opportunities go cold. Integrated email marketing and CRM ensures every team member (even service) sees complete prospect history (i.e., which emails they opened, which content they downloaded, and which webinars they attended). HubSpot's unified CRM means your email engagement data automatically informs all customer conversations from marketing to sales to service. Your team knows exactly what the person has been through with your firm, leading to more relevant discussions and faster closes.  Source Great email marketing platforms provide detailed analytics that show which campaigns drive engagement, which content resonates, and which leads are sales-ready. HubSpot's attribution reporting connects email engagement to closed deals, proving marketing's contribution to revenue. Track which campaigns generate the highest-value clients and double down on what works. Research reveals that 90% of consulting clients rank communication frequency as crucial when they decide to stay with an advisor and make referrals. Consultants who succeed know they must send the right type of email at the right time, and automation enables this at scale. Welcome sequences for new subscribers, proposal follow-ups, and client onboarding can all run automatically while you focus on billable work. HubSpot's marketing automation handles repetitive tasks like appointment confirmations, content delivery, and lead scoring. This operational efficiency means you can nurture more prospects without expanding your team. Not all email features matter equally for consulting firms. Focus on these capabilities that directly support complex sales cycles, relationship-based selling, and thought leadership positioning. Consulting firms often work with diverse prospects across industries, company sizes, and maturity stages. Basic list management isn't enough. You need granular segmentation based on multiple criteria, including engagement level, specific services of interest, and where prospects are in their buying journey. HubSpot's smart lists automatically update as contacts take action, ensuring segments stay current without manual maintenance. According to 3cLogic, 80% of sales require five follow-ups after the first meeting, yet 44% of sales reps give up after only one follow-up. Furthermore, manual follow-up doesn't scale when you nurture dozens of prospects simultaneously through multi-month sales cycles. Automated workflows help in both of these instances. They maintain consistent communication with mutual contacts simultaneously. HubSpot's visual workflow builder makes it easy to create sophisticated nurture sequences without technical knowledge, triggering relevant content based on prospect actions. Consulting firm leaders need to know which marketing activities drive revenue, not just vanity metrics like open rates. For instance, if you can show that a specific email campaign generated three $150K projects, you can justify marketing investment and optimize future campaigns. HubSpot's revenue attribution reports track the complete journey from first email touch to closed deal, showing which campaigns contribute most to your bottom line. Email marketing platforms that operate separately from your sales process create blind spots and can duplicate effort. Proper integration means every email interaction automatically updates contact records, informing sales conversations and triggering appropriate follow-up. I mean, when a prospect opens your proposal follow-up email five times, your sales team should know immediately—that's a hot lead ready for a call. HubSpot's native CRM integration ensures marketing and sales always work from the same data, eliminating silos that cause prospects to fall through the cracks. 65% of all email opens now happen on mobile devices, and executives are increasingly reading email on smartphones between meetings. Your campaigns must look professional and function perfectly on small screens, or you'll lose credibility. HubSpot's responsive email templates automatically adapt to any screen size, ensuring your brand looks polished everywhere prospects engage.  Source Not all email engagement signals the same level of buying intent. Lead scoring helps you identify which prospects actively evaluate solutions versus those casually browsing. Consulting sales cycles are long and resource-intensive. Lead qualification can focus your team's time on prospects showing genuine buying signals. HubSpot's predictive lead scoring uses AI to identify which prospects match your best customers' behavior patterns, surfacing opportunities before competitors reach them. What works for one audience segment may flop with another. A/B testing lets you experiment to know for sure and to continuously improve campaign performance. Small improvements in email effectiveness compound over time. A subject line that increases open rates by 5% means hundreds of additional prospects seeing your expertise over a year. HubSpot's A/B testing tools let you test different approaches and automatically send the winning version to the rest of your list. Follow this structured approach to evaluate email marketing platforms and select one that truly fits your consulting firm‘s needs, not just the vendor’s ideal customer profile. Start by documenting how prospects currently become clients. What touchpoints matter? How long does the process take? Where do prospects get stuck? Understanding your actual workflow prevents you from buying features you won't use while missing capabilities you actually need. Map these paths first, so you know what your email marketing tool to support. Based on your activities, distinguish between essential features and those that sound impressive but won‘t be used. If you don’t host events, for example, advanced event management is irrelevant to your email marketing efforts. Consider what would break your email marketing process if it were missing. Prioritize platforms that nail these essentials over those offering dozens of features you'll never use. For most consulting firms, HubSpot‘s combination of CRM, automation, and analytics makes it a robust solution. It’s one platform that handles the client journey rather than forcing you to connect multiple tools. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. The most powerful platform is worthless if your team won't use it. Consider technical skill levels, available training time, and whether you need a dedicated marketing person to run campaigns. Simple interfaces accelerate adoption while complex ones gather dust. Test interfaces during free trials, focusing on tasks you‘ll do daily, not impressive features you’ll use rarely. HubSpot is known for its intuitive and user-friendly interface. Most consultants can use it without becoming marketers, and it offers depth for teams with dedicated marketing resources. We also have robust training resources and easy-to-contact support via live chat and phone. Look beyond starting prices to understand costs as your contact numbers and sending volume increase. Many platforms appear affordable at first, but become expensive as you grow. Analyze and factor in per-contact pricing increases, feature tier upgrades, and additional user seats. Also, calculate the 12-month total cost of ownership, not just month one. HubSpot's transparent pricing and free plans mean you know exactly what growth costs, and the value often justifies premium pricing as deal sizes increase. Your needs will evolve as your firm grows. The platform you choose should support your current stage while scaling to accommodate future complexity. Can this platform handle automated client onboarding when you scale? Will it integrate with future tools you might need? Does the vendor show commitment to innovation and regular updates? Avoid tools with rigid contact limits, limited user seats, or features locked behind impossible price jumps. HubSpot's platform flexibility makes it ideal for growing consulting firms. You can start with basic email marketing and gradually adopt sales automation, customer service tools, and advanced analytics as your needs expand, all within one integrated system. Building effective email campaigns requires strategic thinking about your audience, clear messaging that showcases expertise, and systematic testing to improve performance over time. Read: How to Launch a Successful Email Marketing Campaign: Tips + Data from an Email Marketer Every campaign should have one primary objective (i.e., generating event registrations, nurturing cold leads, following up on proposals, or re-engaging dormant contacts). Vague campaigns produce vague results. Simultaneously, identify exactly who should receive this message based on their industry, role, engagement level, or stage in the buying journey. Start by asking: What specific action do I want recipients to take? Who will most likely take that action based on their current relationship with our firm? Create segments in your email platform that match these criteria—don't send the same message to everyone. Using HubSpot: Create smart lists that automatically include contacts matching your criteria (e.g., CFOs at mid-market companies who downloaded your whitepaper but haven‘t engaged in 60 days). HubSpot’s segmentation ensures you're always messaging the right people with relevant content. With your goals and list complete, now’s the time to write your email or emails. Your subject line determines whether prospects open your email or ignore it among the dozens they receive daily. Subject line personalization can increase open rates. So, focus on value, curiosity, or urgency—avoid clickbait that damages credibility. Keep subject lines under 50 characters so mobile users see the complete message. Use preview text (the line below the subject in most email clients) to expand on your promise and increase opens. Test different approaches to learn what resonates with your audience. Using HubSpot: AI tools like HubSpot’s Breeze can help you draft this copy, including your subject lines and preview text. You can also A/B your emails so you can identify what drives opens. HubSpot automatically sends the winning version to the rest of your list, continuously improving campaign performance. With most emails opened on smartphones, responsive design isn't optional. Choose or create templates for your campaign that automatically adjust to screen size and mobile behaviors. This means using single-column layouts, large fonts (14pt minimum for body text), and prominent buttons rather than text links. Every email should also only have one primary call-to-action that's impossible to miss. Using HubSpot: All HubSpot templates are mobile-responsive by default. The drag-and-drop editor shows mobile previews, and you can customize mobile layouts separately if needed — ensuring perfect display on every device. Map your ideal follow-up sequence, then build workflows that execute it automatically. Depending on your campaign, include delays between emails (3-5 days typically), conditional logic that adapts based on engagement, and automatic goal tracking that stops sequences when prospects convert. Using HubSpot: Create visual workflows that nurture prospects throughout your sales cycle. Triggers can include form submissions, email clicks, page visits, or CRM events—enabling sophisticated automation that feels personal. HubSpot's AI can even suggest workflow improvements based on performance data. Your email send is just the start of your work. Real email marketing growth and results come from systematic improvement based on data. Track opens, clicks, and conversions, but also monitor metrics that predict revenue like sales-qualified leads generated, opportunities created, and deals closed that touched your campaign. Review performance 3-5 days after sending for early signals, then again after 30 days to see complete impact. Take note of which subject lines work best, which segments engage most, and what CTAs drive action. Apply these insights to future campaigns. Using HubSpot: Campaign analytics connect email performance to revenue outcomes. See which emails contributed to closed deals, which content types generate the most pipeline, and where prospects engage before converting. HubSpot‘s attribution reporting proves email marketing’s ROI, justifying continued investment. HubSpot is arguably the best email marketing tool for most consulting firms because it combines email marketing with an integrated CRM, sales automation, and comprehensive analytics in one platform. Consulting firms using HubSpot report significant improvements in lead generation. Consulting agency, Digistorm firm saw an 45% increase in leads using HubSpot, while Thomas Witt Consulting generated over 80,000 British pounds from a single client acquired using HubSpot. The “best,” however, depends on your specific needs. The right choice balances features you'll actually use, ease of team adoption, and sustainable costs as you grow. Prioritize these essential features for consulting firms: HubSpot includes all these features in its integrated platform, making it the most comprehensive solution for consulting firms that want to grow systematically rather than rely on referrals alone. Yes, HubSpot is excellent for consulting firms. Thomas Witt Consulting achieved over 1,000% ROI in the first year using HubSpot. Can’t argue with that! HubSpot works particularly well for consulting firms because: HubSpot's free tier lets you start risk-free, and its extensive training resources (HubSpot Academy) help consulting teams implement inbound marketing effectively. Email marketing software pricing for consulting firms ranges from free to several hundred dollars monthly, depending on the number of contacts (most platforms charge based on list size), feature requirements (automation and CRM capabilities cost more), and integration needs (all-in-one platforms cost more than single-purpose tools). HubSpot, MailerLite, and Brevo all offer free plans suitable for solo consultants or small firms getting started. HubSpot can also scale to offer many premium features for enterprise-level firms. HubSpot has become the platform of choice for ambitious consulting firms because it does something competitors can‘t: combine email marketing, CRM, sales automation, and analytics into one system that’s actually easy to use. Instead of duct-taping together multiple tools and hoping data syncs correctly, you get a unified platform designed specifically for relationship-based selling, and you can get started for free. Why consulting firms choose HubSpot: Real consulting firms achieving real results: Thomas Witt Consulting used HubSpot‘s integrated approach to land a long-pursued ""white whale"" client. Digistorm, specializing in educational technology, implemented HubSpot and saw a 105% traffic increase. The platform’s automation capabilities saved their team countless hours while the integrated CRM gave them complete visibility into their sales pipeline.

Author John Green talks to Masters in Marketing about ""TB's huge marketing problem"" Updated: 
  
    
  
  
  
    10/24/25
  

  You might know him as the author of YA bestsellers like The Fault in Our Stars, but John Green's most recent book is a nonfiction defense of its own title: In Everything is Tuberculosis, he argues that tuberculosis has shaped everything around us.  For instance: When a hatmaker in the 1850s started coughing up blood, his doctor told him to head West, where the dry air would heal him. The hats in the West, Green writes, “sucked” — they were either “bug-infested, brimless coonskin caps” or “wide-brimmed straw hats that … leaked in the rain.” So the consumptive hatmaker — one John B. Stetson — designed the cowboy hat. Upon finishing the book, I fired off an interview request to try to get an answer to my burning question: Could John Green make a connection between marketing and tuberculosis?  When Green got invited to discuss a possible partnership with Dr Pepper, he was over the moon, so to speak. (He showed up 10 minutes early. To Zoom. Dude really likes Dr Pepper.) He had a modest proposal: that Dr Pepper sponsor humanity’s relationship with the moon. (Pause for impact.) Green would make videos about humanity’s relationship with the moon, sponsored by Dr Pepper. “I‘ve always thought this was a funny idea — that you can’t sponsor a heavenly body, but you can sponsor humanity's relationship with a heavenly body.” He didn’t get a follow-up meeting.  Green doesn’t fault Dr Pepper (the missing period isn’t a typo —“it‘s a big part of Dr Pepper’s brand identity, whether they know it or not”). It’s an absurd idea. But that’s kind of the whole point: “I'm not particularly interested in doing a brand deal for the sake of doing a brand deal. I'm interested in brand deals that can enhance the absurdity and joy in the world.” A post shared by John Green (@johngreenwritesbooks) Passion is powerful fuel. Whether the endeavor is personal or professional, passion can give you wings and make you soar — and it can bring you a little too close to the sun. So I asked Green, who’s successfully scaled more passion projects than I’ve so much as dreamt of, what his early-warning system is. How do you know when growth is going to kill what made your project so special? “I think the most important thing is the very first person you hire who isn't you,” he says. “Making sure that their values fit, that they share your passion, that they want the same thing out of the project that you want.” With Crash Course, the educational YouTube channel Green co-founded with his brother, internet science guy Hank Green, the first hire “was a guy who, like me, loves history; who, like me, loves online video; who's really passionate about trying to reach people with educational media. I don't think he was concerned with being able to market effectively. I think he was concerned with making awesome videos that became undeniable and that served a real purpose in the lives of the people who use them.”  “In some ways with Crash Course, the marketing took care of itself because kids would go into their high school history classes and say to their teacher, “Hey, I think you should watch this show. It‘s really good. It’s called Crash Course.” “It was really kind of bottom-up that way. The way that we marketed it was essentially marketing it to students and then letting teachers discover it through their kids.” Green acknowledges that he’s been very lucky in some business ventures, which has let him take risks — it was the runaway success of The Fault in Our Stars, he says, that let him and his brother build their YouTube channel Crash Course for two and a half years before they saw a single dime.  That’s an enviable position for any marketer to be in, but his wisdom is budget-agnostic: “I believe in an ROI that unfolds over long periods of time, not an ROI that can be immediately measurable.” And “sometimes ROI gets in the way. You know, what you really want to have is a core group of enthusiastic customers. And I think sometimes it's a mistake to market to what you see as a demographic rather than marketing to a core group of enthusiastic customers.” Take his coffee company, for instance. “There‘s no particular demographic. It’s not like we sell coffee to women between the ages of 24 and 30,” says Green. The common denominator instead is “people who are interested in purchasing coffee in a way that‘s ethically sourced and where all the profit goes to charity. That’s not a demographic audience. It's more of a vibes-based, values-based audience.” Although he’s best known for his young adult novels and more recent nonfiction books, Green is also something of a serial co-founder of small businesses — DFTBA, Complexly, and Good Store are but a few. There’s a through-line of joy in his business ventures; helping small content creators finance and sustain their work, helping nurses-to-be pass their anatomy and physiology exams, selling ethically grown coffee. “I like working with brands that empower creators and that recognize the benefit of working with creators, which is that you‘re going to be a little bit off the beaten path. That’s what I find most interesting. That's also the riskiest kind of investment that you can make as a marketer. And so I understand why lots of people don't make it.” Green has a remarkably devoted audience that has followed him across platforms, from YA books to YouTube to Instagram to awesome socks. For somebody who describes himself as “extremely risk averse — especially when it comes to taking risks with [my] audience,” he sure has taken a lot of risks with his audience. “It‘s about answering the call of my own inspiration as much as it’s about and then trusting that the audience will be there one way or another,” he explains. “I mean, if you told me in 2015 that I was going to write a book about tuberculosis, I would have been very surprised. But that's where my curiosity has led me over the last 10 years. And so I just have to honor that and hope that the audience will be there with me.”  Marketers might call it authenticity, but Green prefers “creative honesty.” “Everybody talks about being authentic to themselves, but that’s a very hard thing to actually be,” he says. “Whereas when you‘re trying to be honest to your sense of inspiration or spark of curiosity, I think that’s something that I can quantify a little easier.” So, back to tuberculosis, the world’s deadliest infectious disease (yes, even in 2025). Green says that a TB expert once told him that the problem with eradicating the disease is that “tuberculosis doesn’t have a constituency.” Green’s first reaction was one of incredulity. “I was like, of course tuberculosis has a constituency. It has 10 million people who survive it each year who want to live in a world without it. And it has hundreds of millions of people who are infected with it, who don't want to become sick with it. This is obviously a disease with a constituency.” But what that expert meant, Green thinks, is that tuberculosis actually has a huge marketing problem. “Most people don‘t even know that it’s the deadliest infectious disease in the world, let alone that it's curable and preventable and has been since the 1950s. And so I think that TB is the ultimate example of a disease in need of a marketing campaign.” “Malaria,” he says, “had a really good one in the early 2000s with Malaria No More. ACT UP made HIV/AIDS undeniable starting in the 1980s and 90s. We need a similar marketing campaign around tuberculosis.”  And, he adds, “I don‘t have to tell marketers that we live in a very fractured information environment. It’s hard to reach people, with tough messages especially.” “So yeah, I think [marketing and tuberculosis are] very closely related, because I think one of the reasons why a million and a half people are dying of tuberculosis every year is because we're not doing a good job of spreading the word about the disease in the rich world.” Your move, marketers.

Re-engaging lapsed customers? Clear goals guide everything from subject lines to offers. Divide contacts into targeted groups: first-time visitors versus regulars, lunch versus dinner customers, dietary preferences (vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.), high spenders versus value seekers, and inactive guests. [Segmented restaurant campaigns] [generate 65% higher open rates] [than generic broadcasts]. Build templates that showcase your food beautifully while displaying properly on smartphones (where 75% of restaurant emails are opened). Use high-quality food photography, single-column layouts, clear hierarchy, and large tap-friendly buttons for reservations. Communicate value and urgency immediately. Examples: “Tonight Only: 20% Off All Wine,” “Your Birthday Dinner is On Us,” “New Fall Menu Just Dropped,” or “Table for 2 Available This Saturday.” Keep subject lines under 40 characters and include time-sensitive language. Direct recipients toward one primary action: make a reservation, order online, buy a gift card, register for an event, or redeem an offer. Multiple CTAs create confusion. Place your primary CTA prominently with contrasting colors and action-oriented text. Configure triggered follow-ups based on guest behavior. Send thank you emails within 24 hours of dining. Follow up with review requests 2-3 days later. Create win-back campaigns for guests who haven't visited in 30-60-90 days with escalating offers. Track opens, clicks, reservations, and revenue generated. Test different send times to find when your customers are most likely to engage. Many restaurants see best results sending lunch promotions Tuesday-Thursday mornings and dinner promotions Thursday-Friday afternoons.

Email marketing software automatically notifies clients of upcoming tax deadlines based on their service type. Accounting firms reduce last-minute document submissions by 40% using automated deadline reminders. Your staff saves 8-12 hours weekly on outbound calls. Email keeps you top-of-mind during slow seasons. When client interaction drops between tax deadlines and year-end planning, strategic email campaigns maintain engagement. Share financial tips, regulatory updates, and advisory insights. Identify clients ready for additional services by tracking who engages with your advisory content. Accounting firms increase advisory service adoption by using behavioral email triggers. Turn tax-only clients into full-service relationships. Systematic referral campaigns encourage satisfied clients to recommend your firm. Firms generate more qualified leads with automated referral sequences as automation formalizes a highly successful, but often passive, form of marketing. Time your requests after positive experiences, such as successful tax outcomes. See which campaigns generate consultations, service upgrades, and referrals. Replace guesswork with concrete metrics: open rates, click-throughs, conversions, and revenue attribution. Prove marketing ROI to partners and justify continued investment. Document all recurring touchpoints throughout the year: tax season communications, quarterly reminders, year-end planning, CPE events, regulatory updates, and financial education content. Identify what's manual and what could be automated. Tax-focused practices need deadline automation and seasonal scheduling. Advisory-focused firms need sophisticated nurturing and behavioral tracking. Multi-service practices need advanced segmentation. List your absolute requirements versus nice-to-haves. Test platforms during free trials. Can your team create campaigns independently, or will you need ongoing support? Constant Contact and AWeber suit beginners. ActiveCampaign and HubSpot offer more power but require more expertise. Calculate costs as your database grows over 12-24 months. Some platforms charge per contact, others per email sent. Project your list size (active clients, prospects, and referral sources) and check pricing accordingly. Include costs for add-ons like SMS or landing pages. Pick a platform that scales without forcing you to migrate later. HubSpot supports accounting firms from solo practitioners through multi-partner practices with one unified platform. Start with the free tier, then upgrade as you grow—no data migration required. Set a clear goal before creating content. Are you promoting tax prep before deadlines? Educating about new regulations? Announcing expanded services? Nurturing leads? Reactivating dormant clients? Clear objectives guide everything else. Divide contacts into targeted groups: business versus individual clients, tax-only versus advisory, active versus inactive, high-value versus standard service. Segmented campaigns generate 58% of all revenue Build templates that maintain your brand while displaying properly on smartphones (where 67% of emails are opened). Use single-column layouts, clear hierarchy, professional colors, and large buttons. Communicate relevance immediately. Examples: “Q4 Estimated Tax Payment Due December 15,” “New 2025 Tax Law Changes Affecting Your Business,” or “Ready for Year-End Tax Planning?” Keep subject lines under 40 characters. Direct recipients toward one primary action: schedule consultations, download guides, register for webinars, or upload documents. Multiple CTAs create decision paralysis. Place your primary CTA prominently with contrasting colors. Configure triggered follow-ups based on behavior. Send reminder emails to non-openers after 2-3 days with different subject lines. Follow up on clicks with additional information. Create abandoned booking sequences to recover 15-25% of incomplete scheduling. Track opens, clicks, conversions, unsubscribes, and revenue. Compare against professional services benchmarks (24% open rate, 3.2% click-through rate). Identify what works and replicate it in future campaigns. HubSpot is the best email marketing tool for accounting firms because it combines email, CRM, client portals, and automation in one platform. The free tier includes unlimited contacts, email marketing, forms, landing pages, and CRM—accessible for solo practitioners and small firms. Multi-partner practices benefit from revenue attribution that connects campaigns to client acquisitions and service upgrades. Accounting firms using HubSpot increased client retention rates through automated year-round engagement. Look for tax deadline automation, client segmentation by service type, CRM integration, compliance-friendly templates, document sharing integration, mobile optimization, behavioral automation, A/B testing, landing page builders, and revenue attribution. Tax deadline automation ensures timely reminders without manual work. CRM integration eliminates duplicate data entry. Mobile optimization matters because 81% of consumers prefer to use their smartphones to open and respond to emails. Yes, HubSpot is excellent for accounting firms. It provides one platform for marketing, sales, and client service—designed for long-term professional relationships. The free CRM tracks every client interaction over multiple years. Marketing automation enables the creation of workflows for tax reminders, client education, and advisory promotions, eliminating the need for technical expertise. Multi-partner accounting practices increased advisory service adoption by using HubSpot's behavioral email triggers. Solo practitioners start free, then scale up as they grow. Email marketing software costs $0-$3,600+ monthly, depending on database size, features, and practice scale. Free tiers support 250-1,000 contacts with basic features. Entry-level paid plans cost $12-$ 29 per month for under 1,000 contacts. Mid-market firms with 2,500-5,000 contacts typically spend $50-200 monthly. Large, multi-partner practices with 10,000+ contacts invest $ 500-$3,600+ monthly. Some platforms charge per contact, others per email sent—compare carefully as your list grows. Use double opt-in for new contacts, remove inactive subscribers regularly, authenticate your domain with SPF and DKIM records, avoid spam trigger words, send consistent volumes, segment for relevance, personalize sender names, and monitor bounce rates. Aim for 95%+ inbox placement and under 0.1% spam complaints. Only email people who opted in, and provide clear value in every communication. HubSpot combines email marketing, CRM, client communication, and service tracking into one platform designed for professional services. Over 184,000 businesses trust HubSpot worldwide because it eliminates the need for multiple disconnected tools. Key HubSpot Features for Accounting Firms: HubSpot's Impact on Accounting Firms: Multi-partner accounting practices increased client retention rates with HubSpot's year-round engagement campaigns beyond tax season. CPA firms using HubSpot generated more advisory service revenue by identifying tax-only clients ready for expanded services. Accounting practices reduced client acquisition costs by using HubSpot's integrated platform that eliminated separate CRM, email, and portal subscriptions. Solo practitioners saved 12 hours weekly by automating tax reminders, document follow-ups, and referral requests. HubSpot's free tier gives you complete CRM and email marketing without a credit card. Paid tiers start at $9 monthly per seat and scale up to enterprise solutions with advanced analytics, custom reporting, and API integrations.

  Real estate professionals face unique challenges when it comes to staying top-of-mind with clients, nurturing leads through long sales cycles, and managing relationships with both buyers and sellers simultaneously.  Email marketing addresses these challenges by enabling agents and brokerages to deliver personalized property listings, market updates, and timely follow-ups that keep prospects engaged throughout their home-buying or selling journey. This post provides a comprehensive comparison of the best email marketing tools for real estate businesses, including detailed feature breakdowns, pricing information, and a structured guide to help you choose the right platform. We'll compare tools and share how HubSpot has successfully aided businesses like Avison Young, a global real estate advisor with over 5,000 employees, with increased CRM adoption from 23% to 90% in four months using its integrated email marketing and platform. Table of Contents Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for real estate enables agents and brokerages to build relationships with prospective buyers, sellers, and past clients through targeted campaigns. Real estate email marketing automates property alerts, market updates, and nurture sequences that guide leads through extended decision-making processes while maintaining consistent touchpoints that drive referrals and repeat business. Email Marketing Tool Best For Key Features Pricing Average Rating HubSpot Full-service real estate marketing with CRM integration Drag-and-drop builder, property listing automation, lead scoring, CRM integration Free plan available; Marketing Hub starts at $15/month 4.4/5 Mailchimp Small agencies needing basic email campaigns Template library, basic automation, audience segmentation Free for up to 500 contacts; paid plans from $13/month 4.3/5 Constant Contact Agents prioritizing ease of use and templates Real estate-specific templates, list management, event marketing Plans from $12/month 4.0/5 ActiveCampaign Brokerages requiring advanced automation Complex automation workflows, CRM features, lead scoring Plans from $29/month 4.6/5 BombBomb Video-focused real estate marketing Video email integration, tracking analytics, mobile app Plans from $33/month 4.5/5 Selecting the right email marketing platform can transform how real estate professionals nurture leads and close deals.

When evaluating email marketing platforms for real estate businesses, prioritize these capabilities: Follow this structured process to select the email marketing platform that best fits your real estate business: Document how you currently manage client communication, property marketing, and lead follow-up processes. Identify pain points like manual follow-up tasks, difficulty tracking client property interests, or time-consuming campaign creation that an email platform should solve. Determine which features are non-negotiable for your business model. Solo agents might prioritize ease of use and templates, while growing brokerages often require CRM integration, team collaboration tools, and advanced automation capabilities. Evaluate platform interfaces to ensure your team can effectively use the tools without extensive training. Request demos or free trials to test campaign creation, automation setup, and reporting interfaces before committing. Calculate total costs as your contact database grows. Some platforms offer attractive entry pricing but become expensive at higher contact volumes, while others provide better value for growing businesses. Select a platform that grows with your business and integrates with other tools in your marketing stack. HubSpot provides real estate businesses with email marketing, CRM, landing pages, and analytics in a unified platform, eliminating the need to connect multiple disconnected tools. Real estate businesses, such as Havenpark Communities, closed 6,000 deals and decreased deal cycle time-to-close by 51% using HubSpot's integrated platform between 2019 and 2021. Establish clear goals for each campaign — whether generating open house attendance, promoting new listings, nurturing long-term buyer relationships, or soliciting seller leads—before designing content or selecting recipients. Divide your contact database into meaningful groups based on factors like buyer versus seller status, price range interests, neighborhood preferences, and stage in the transaction process to ensure relevant messaging. Create email templates that showcase property images beautifully on smartphones and tablets, with clear calls-to-action that are easy to tap and text that remains readable without zooming. Use available data about client preferences, past property views, and stated interests to curate property selections that feel hand-picked rather than mass-distributed, increasing engagement and response rates. Build automated workflows that send timely follow-up messages after open houses, property inquiries, or listing alerts, maintaining momentum without requiring manual sends for every interaction. Continuously test subject lines, send times, content formats, and calls-to-action, using performance data to optimize future campaigns for higher open rates and conversions. HubSpot stands out as the best email marketing tool for real estate businesses because it combines email automation with CRM capabilities, lead scoring, and property listing management in a single platform. Real estate professionals using HubSpot benefit from integrated tools that track every client interaction from initial email engagement through transaction close, eliminating data silos between marketing and sales activities. Real estate email marketing tools should include CRM integration for client relationship tracking, automated property listing distribution, behavioral segmentation for targeted messaging, mobile-responsive templates, lead scoring to prioritize hot prospects, and drip campaign capabilities for long-term nurturing. Advanced platforms also offer A/B testing, video email integration, and detailed analytics showing which properties generate the most interest. HubSpot excels for real estate businesses of all sizes. The platform provides real estate agents and brokerages with email marketing, contact management, deal pipeline tracking, and reporting tools that work together seamlessly. HubSpot's free tier offers sufficient functionality for individual agents getting started, while paid tiers scale to support large brokerages with complex automation needs. Avison Young increased CRM adoption from 23% to 90% in four months using HubSpot, now tracking 95% of North American revenue on the platform. Havenpark Communities decreased deal cycle time-to-close by 51% and closed 6,000 deals between 2019 and 2021 using HubSpot's integrated marketing and sales workflows. Email marketing software for real estate ranges from free plans suitable for new agents to enterprise solutions costing several thousand dollars monthly. Entry-level options like HubSpot‘s free plan, Mailchimp’s free tier (up to 500 contacts), and Constant Contact ($12/month) serve individual agents and small teams. Mid-tier solutions like ActiveCampaign ($29-$149/month) and BombBomb ($36-$56/month) offer more advanced automation. Growing brokerages should budget $50-$500 monthly depending on contact volume and feature requirements. Email marketing generates real estate leads through consistent nurturing of prospects, automated property alerts that keep agents top-of-mind, and strategic content that positions agents as market experts. Real estate professionals using email marketing maintain relationships with past clients who become referral sources, re-engage cold leads through targeted campaigns, and convert website visitors into qualified prospects through email capture and follow-up sequences. TenantBase achieved 3x revenue growth year-over-year using HubSpot's email marketing and CRM capabilities. HubSpot provides real estate professionals with comprehensive email marketing tools that integrate seamlessly with contact management, deal tracking, and analytics capabilities. The platform enables agents and brokerages to scale their marketing efforts without sacrificing personalization or relationship quality.

  The HVAC industry often means juggling emergency calls, seasonal demand spikes, and fierce local competition. When your schedule‘s packed during summer heatwaves and winter chills but crickets in spring, staying top-of-mind with customers is critical. That’s where email marketing for HVAC companies delivers. Email marketing generates $36–$40 for every $1 spent, making it still one of the most cost-effective marketing channels. In fact, email marketing has an average ROI of 4200% for HVAC companies specifically. But any old email tool won't cut it for HVAC companies. You need tools to handle appointment reminders, seasonal maintenance campaigns, and equipment replacement nurturing without being too technical. The right software automates follow-ups, segments customers by system type, and tracks which campaigns actually fill your calendar. This guide breaks down the best email marketing platforms built for HVAC companies like yours (i.e. HubSpot), complete with pricing, must-have features, and how to pick the right one for you. Note: Heating and air conditioning company Viessmann orders increased by 12% and revenue increased by 15% while using HubSpot. Table of Contents Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for HVAC companies involves using targeted email campaigns to stay connected with customers from the initial installation of their equipment or service through annual maintenance to eventual replacement. Unlike spray-and-pray advertising, email marketing for HVAC companies segments customers by equipment age, service history, or property type, then sends personalized messages when relevant and appropriate. For HVAC contractors, this includes automated appointment reminders, seasonal tune-up campaigns, filter change alerts, and equipment replacement nurturing sequences. The goal? Keep your schedule full year-round while building the customer relationships that turn one-time service calls into lifetime maintenance contracts. HubSpot’s free email marketing tools are a great choice for HVAC companies. So, why do HVAC companies need email marketing software exactly? There are a handful of benefits. HVAC demand fluctuates wildly with seasons, but your customer relationships shouldn't. Email automation keeps you connected during slow periods while nurturing future equipment replacement opportunities.  Source HubSpot's workflows, for example, automatically trigger seasonal maintenance reminders, filter replacement alerts, and tune-up campaigns based on customer equipment age and service history—ensuring no customer falls through the cracks when your schedule lightens. Not every customer needs the same message. I mean, homeowners with 15-year-old systems need equipment replacement nurturing, while commercial clients with maintenance contracts need different touchpoints than residential one-time service customers. The right email marketing tool for HVAC companies will enable this. HubSpot's CRM-powered segmentation lets you create customer lists based on equipment type, property classification, service history, and dozens of other criteria, then automate targeted campaigns that speak to each segment's specific needs. Traditional HVAC advertising (radio spots, direct mail) leaves you guessing which channels drive results. Email marketing shows exactly which campaigns drive bookings and revenue. HubSpot Marketing Hub connects every email to your CRM, attributing appointments and revenue directly to specific campaigns.  Source You'll know whether your spring tune-up campaign generated 15 appointments worth $3,000 or your equipment replacement series closed $45,000 in system installations. One-time service calls keep you busy, but maintenance contracts create predictable recurring revenue that smooths seasonal volatility. Email nurturing converts one-time customers into contract holders. HubSpot lets you create automated sequences that educate customers about preventative maintenance benefits, showcase contract member advantages, and gradually move customers toward enrollment—turning transactional relationships into long-term partnerships. Your email platform shouldn't live in isolation from your scheduling software, CRM, and other business tools. It should speak and work along with them without much manual effort on your part. HubSpot natively integrates with ServiceTitan, Jobber, Housecall Pro, and hundreds of other platforms HVAC contractors already use. Customer data syncs bidirectionally, so your CRM always reflects email engagement, and your email campaigns are personalized automatically based on scheduling system data. Now that you know why you need email marketing software, let’s dig into what you should look for. No two HVAC customers are alike. They can differ dramatically in equipment age, property type, and service needs. Robust segmentation lets you send filter replacement reminders only to customers with specific unit types, target commercial property managers separately from homeowners, and identify systems approaching replacement age. HubSpot lists let you segment by basically any trait or activity logged in your CRM, and if they’re active, they’ll automatically update based on any changes, keeping segments current as customer situations change. Generic automation templates don't address HVAC-specific customer journeys. Look for platforms that let you build workflows around service appointments, seasonal maintenance windows, and equipment lifecycle stages. While not HVAC specific out-of-the-box, HubSpot's visual workflow builder allows you to create sequences like quote request → follow-up email → phone call reminder → closed deal → maintenance reminder → filter replacement → equipment replacement nurturing over multiple years. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Your techs and customers are on the go. They’re accessing email primarily on phones, not desktop computers. In fact, 65% of all email opens now happen on mobile devices. This means responsive design is non-negotiable. You need an email marketing tool that has it built in. HubSpot's email templates automatically adjust for smartphone screens, ensuring your seasonal campaigns and appointment reminders display perfectly regardless of device. You can also preview what your emails look like on a variety of devices before scheduling or sending. Email campaigns inform better service delivery when you know what your customers have been through with your company — what services they’ve received, what emails and conversations they’ve had. An integrated CRM means every email, form submission, and website visit appears in the customer profile alongside service history, so you can use it to inform your marketing. HubSpot's unified platform eliminates data silos. Your marketing team sees service history while your techs reference email engagement before arriving on-site. Starting with a blank canvas can waste time that contractors don't have. Having pre-built templates handy for seasonal tune-ups, maintenance reminders, and equipment replacement campaigns help cut this time and keep things moving quickly. HubSpot provides service business templates you customize with your branding, stock images of HVAC equipment, technicians, and satisfied customers. This eliminates the need for custom photography. Opens and clicks matter less than appointments booked and revenue generated. Look for platforms that attribute business outcomes to specific campaigns. HubSpot's robust analytics connect every email to CRM data, showing exactly which campaigns drove quote requests, maintenance bookings, and equipment sales, plus lifetime value of customers acquired through each marketing channel.

What emails do prospects receive after requesting quotes? How do you nurture equipment replacement over the 10-15 year system lifecycle? When do you send maintenance reminders, filter replacement alerts, seasonal tune-up campaigns? Mapping these touchpoints identifies must-have automation capabilities. HubSpot's journey mapping tools visualize customer progression while its workflow builder automates every stage. Feature priorities differ for residential-only contractors versus commercial HVAC companies, versus hybrid businesses. Residential contractors need strong homeowner segmentation and seasonal campaign automation while commercial-focused companies require account-based features for managing property managers and facility teams. Companies selling equipment online need e-commerce integration. List the non-negotiables for your specific business before comparing platforms. HubSpot's modular approach lets you start with basic email marketing, then add CRM, sales, and service tools as your needs evolve. Your email platform must connect with tools you already use (i.e. scheduling software, CRM, phone system, accounting platform). Manual data entry between systems wastes time and increases the risk of human error. That said, consider whether your email marketing tool options offer native integrations with your scheduling system or require third-party connectors like Zapier. HubSpot maintains hundreds of native integrations with tools HVAC contractors actually use, plus an open API for custom connections. Most email platforms charge per contact, with costs escalating as your database expands. Make sure that, as you grow, you can still afford your tool. Calculate pricing at your current list size, then project costs at 2,500, 5,000, and 10,000 contacts to avoid surprises. Also, compare what's included at each tier, as some platforms lock automation, CRM, or advanced segmentation behind expensive upgrades. HubSpot's transparent pricing includes free CRM for unlimited contacts, with email marketing starting at just $15/month for 1,000 marketing contacts. Early on, you need basic email functionality (i.e. appointment follow up) but as your HVAC business expands, you'll likely need more robust campaigns which use marketing automation, CRM, customer service tools, and sales pipeline management. Platforms that force you to migrate when you outgrow them cost time and money. Look for solutions that scale from startup to enterprise without switching systems. HubSpot's unified platform combines free CRM with optional Marketing Hub, Sales Hub, Service Hub, and Operations Hub — all working together as your business grows. One Richmond HVAC contractor saw impressive upward trends in website visits after implementing HubSpot's integrated platform, demonstrating the value of choosing a scalable solution from the start. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Regardless of which email marketing platform you choose, here are some basic steps you can follow to create your first campaigns. Establish clear, measurable goals for each email campaign before creating content. This gives you direction on your messaging and segmentation and something to help you evaluate how you’re doing. HubSpot's campaign management tools enable setting specific goals, such as appointment bookings or consultation requests, tracking performance against those targets in real time, and calculating ROI by attributing revenue directly to specific campaigns. Pro tip: Keep a Seasonal Campaign Calendar HVAC businesses live and die by seasons. Plan campaigns 3-6 months in advance around key periods: spring AC preparation, summer emergency service availability, fall heating system checks, winter freeze protection tips, and off-season equipment replacement opportunities. Scheduling these campaigns to reach customers 2-4 weeks before peak demand will help you get ahead of the competition. HubSpot's campaign planning tools let you build entire seasonal strategies, assign workflows, and track performance across related emails in unified dashboards. Email marketing effectiveness depends on targeting the right customers with relevant messages. Start by importing existing customers from your scheduling software if needed. Then segment according to your goals. Perhaps this means targeting a specific geographic region, equipment type, or even residential versus commercial. Whatever the traits may be, HubSpot's lists tool can import contacts from spreadsheets or directly from your CRM, while active lists automatically update based on customer behaviors and attributes. With your goals and list complete, now’s the time to write your email or emails. AI tools like HubSpot’s Breeze can help you draft this copy, even right within the email tool. With most emails opened on smartphones, responsive design isn't optional. Choose or create templates for your campaign that automatically adjust to screen size and mobile behaviors. This means including clear calls-to-action with large, thumb-friendly buttons linking to your booking page and eliminating clutter. HubSpot's email builder shows you how your email will appear on a variety of devices. It also provides service business templates you can customize with your branding. This ensures a professional appearance across all devices without the need for design expertise. Rather than manually sending, build an automated sequence that triggers based on customer actions or dates. Essential workflows for HVAC may include: HubSpot‘s workflow builder uses drag-and-drop logic to create sophisticated sequences. For example, if a customer opens a spring tune-up email but doesn’t book, an early-bird discount is automatically sent three days later. Monitor which campaigns drive actual appointments and revenue, not just email metrics. Test subject lines, send times, offers, and calls-to-action to improve conversion rates. Review unsubscription patterns to identify content customers don‘t want. Track customer lifetime value by acquisition source to understand which campaigns attract your most valuable customers. HubSpot’s marketing analytics connect email engagement to appointments booked and revenue generated, showing exactly which campaigns fill your calendar and grow your business. This depends on your needs, but HubSpot Marketing Hub stands out as the top email marketing choice for HVAC companies because it combines powerful automation with an integrated CRM that tracks customer relationships from first contact through years of service history. HubSpot connects marketing campaigns directly to your customer database, appointment scheduling, and revenue attribution, unlike standalone email platforms and in-FSM email tools. This unified approach means you can segment customers by equipment age and service history, automate seasonal campaigns based on CRM data, and get performance analytics to improve each campaign. One HVAC contractor used HubSpot's automated drip campaigns to upsell existing customers on their membership program, generating several new leads and signups in the early stages. For contractors already using field service management software, ServiceTitan Marketing Pro and Housecall Pro Campaigns offer native integrations that eliminate data sync challenges. Prioritize platforms with robust customer segmentation (e.g. equipment type, age, property type), appointment-focused automation workflows, mobile-optimized templates, CRM integration, and analytics that connect emails to actual revenue. HVAC-specific needs include seasonal campaign scheduling, maintenance reminder automation, equipment lifecycle tracking, and integration with scheduling software like ServiceTitan or Jobber. HubSpot excels in all these areas while adding unified customer profiles that show email engagement alongside service history, creating seamless handoffs between marketing and service teams. Absolutely. HubSpot serves HVAC companies extremely well because it solves the industry's core marketing challenges: staying connected during slow seasons, nurturing long-term equipment replacement opportunities, converting one-time customers into maintenance contract holders, and tracking marketing ROI accurately. Multiple HVAC companies have documented strong results with HubSpot. Aermec North America, an HVAC manufacturer, increased website traffic by 1,377% after implementing HubSpot's Marketing Hub, while Viessmann, a heating and air conditioning company, increased new leads by 16% year-over-year using HubSpot's customer-centric approach and content strategy. Email marketing costs typically range from free plans with limited contacts to $15-50/month for small HVAC businesses and $100-800/month for larger operations, depending on the tool, your contact count, and features needed. Most platforms charge per contact tier, escalating costs as your database grows. HubSpot offers exceptional value with free CRM and email marketing, paid plans starting at just $15/month for 1,000 contacts, and transparent pricing that scales predictably as your business grows. Yes, email marketing is great at combating seasonal volatility that plagues HVAC businesses. Strategic campaigns keep you top-of-mind during shoulder seasons while nurturing future opportunities. For instance, you can launch off-season equipment replacement campaigns targeting customers with aging systems when your installation schedule has availability. Send pre-season maintenance reminders 4-6 weeks before peak demand to fill your calendar before competitors. Promote maintenance contracts during slow periods to create recurring revenue streams. A 2024 Blue Corona client campaign sent a “Beat the Summer Rush” AC maintenance email to existing customers, generating 122 service appointments in two weeks with zero paid advertising spend. HubSpot's automation ensures these campaigns deploy consistently without manual effort, while CRM integration identifies exactly which customers need outreach based on equipment age and service history. HubSpot combines email marketing automation with a powerful CRM platform explicitly designed for service businesses like HVAC contractors. Unlike standalone email tools that operate in isolation, HubSpot creates a unified system where marketing campaigns, customer data, and service operations work together seamlessly. Many real HVAC companies have achieved measurable results with HubSpot. Viessmann increased new leads by 16% year-over-year, partner numbers jumped 14%, and revenue grew 15% using HubSpot's customer-centric approach and hubs rather than one-off tools like Mailchimp. And one Richmond-based HVAC contractor generated several new membership program signups through HubSpot's automated upsell campaigns targeted at existing customers.

Email marketing platforms address specific challenges law firms face in maintaining client relationships and generating new business: Time Efficiency Through Automation – Lawyers maintain billable hour requirements while automated email sequences nurture leads, update clients on case progress, and maintain relationships with referral sources without manual effort for each communication. Cost-Effective Lead Generation – Email marketing generates one of the highest ROIs in digital marketing at $36 return for every $1 spent, making it more economical than paid advertising while delivering targeted messages to qualified prospects interested in specific legal services. Compliance and Professionalism – Purpose-built email marketing platforms help lawyers maintain ethical compliance by managing opt-in consent, providing clear unsubscribe options, and maintaining professional communication standards required by bar associations. Client Relationship Management – Integrated CRM features track every client interaction, ensuring lawyers stay informed about client needs, follow up consistently, and provide attentive service that generates referrals and positive reviews. Measurable Marketing Performance – Detailed analytics reveal which practice areas generate the most interest, which messages resonate with potential clients, and which campaigns drive consultation bookings, enabling data-driven marketing decisions. When selecting email marketing software, lawyers should prioritize features that address the unique needs of legal services marketing: Follow this systematic approach to select email marketing software that fits your law firm's specific needs: Document how your firm currently communicates with leads, clients, and referral sources. Identify repetitive communications that could be automated, such as consultation confirmations, new client onboarding emails, case status updates, or referral partner newsletters. Determine which features are essential versus nice-to-have based on your practice. Solo practitioners may prioritize ease of use and affordability, while larger firms might require multi-user access, advanced segmentation, and CRM integration with existing practice management software. Test platforms during free trials to evaluate interface intuitiveness, template quality, and whether your team can use the software effectively without extensive training. Consider how much time team members can realistically dedicate to email marketing beyond billable work. Review pricing tiers carefully, as costs increase significantly with contact list growth. Calculate total cost including contact limits, monthly email sends, and additional fees for features like SMS marketing or inbox preview testing. Select software that grows with your firm and integrates with other tools you use. Legartis reduced cost per lead by 75% and increased the number of marketing qualified leads by 20X using HubSpot's integrated platform, demonstrating how comprehensive solutions deliver superior results as firms scale their marketing efforts. Effective email marketing campaigns for lawyers follow a structured approach that builds trust while demonstrating legal expertise. Establish specific objectives for each email campaign, whether generating consultation bookings, educating potential clients about specific legal matters, maintaining relationships with past clients who might refer new business, or staying top-of-mind with referral sources. Collect email addresses through website forms, consultation requests, networking events, and existing client relationships. Ensure clear opt-in consent and provide transparent information about email frequency and content to maintain compliance with CAN-SPAM, GDPR, and bar association rules. Divide contacts into meaningful groups based on practice area interest, current client status, referral source type, or engagement level. Send targeted content that addresses specific legal needs rather than generic messages to your entire database. Develop emails that provide genuine value through legal insights, answers to common questions, case study succaries, or practical guidance. Avoid legal jargon that confuses non-lawyers and focus on clear explanations that demonstrate expertise while remaining accessible. Use responsive email templates that maintain professional appearance across desktop and mobile devices. Include your firm's branding, clear calls-to-action, and proper legal disclaimers about attorney-client relationships. Conduct A/B tests on subject lines, sending times, and content approaches to identify what resonates with your audience. Monitor metrics like open rates, click-through rates, and consultation bookings to continuously improve campaign performance. Establish regular sending schedules that keep your firm top-of-mind without overwhelming recipients. Most law firms find success with monthly newsletters supplemented by targeted campaigns for specific practice areas or timely legal developments. HubSpot stands out as the best email marketing tool for lawyers because it integrates CRM, email marketing, and automation in a single platform. Campmany Abogados increased its visitor-to-lead conversion rate from below 1% to 4% and boosted client numbers by 7X using HubSpot. For budget-conscious solo practitioners, Mailchimp offers excellent value with practice management software integrations, while ActiveCampaign provides sophisticated automation for firms with complex nurturing needs. Prioritize practice management software integration, advanced segmentation by practice area and case type, compliance features for managing consent and privacy, automation for client onboarding and case updates, mobile optimization for clients checking email on smartphones, high deliverability rates to ensure messages reach inboxes, and detailed analytics to track which campaigns generate consultations. CRM capabilities help track every client interaction for better relationship management. Yes, HubSpot excels for legal practices of all sizes. A Houston-based law firm improved productivity by 25% and decreased non-billable time by 40% using HubSpot. The platform combines contact management, email marketing, automation, and analytics in one system, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools. HubSpot's free CRM makes it accessible to solo practitioners, while paid tiers scale effectively as firms grow. The platform integrates with legal practice management software and provides workflows specifically designed for client intake, case management, and referral nurturing. Email marketing software costs vary significantly based on features and contact list size. Free plans exist from HubSpot, Mailchimp, and Brevo for small contact lists with basic features. Entry-level paid plans start around $10-20/month for 500 contacts but increase substantially as lists grow. Mid-tier plans with automation typically range from $30-60/month, while enterprise solutions can exceed $100/month. Consider total cost including contact limits, monthly send volumes, and additional fees for features like SMS, inbox preview, or additional users. Most platforms offer free trials to test functionality before committing. Lawyers must comply with multiple regulations when conducting email marketing. CAN-SPAM Act requires accurate sender information, clear opt-out mechanisms, and truthful subject lines. GDPR applies when emailing EU residents and requires explicit consent and easy data access. Bar association rules vary by jurisdiction but generally prohibit false or misleading communications, require legal disclaimers, and may restrict testimonials. Always include unsubscribe links, use professional language, avoid guaranteeing outcomes, and maintain clear records of consent. Email marketing platforms typically provide built-in compliance tools, but lawyers remain responsible for ethical advertising practices. HubSpot provides the comprehensive platform law firms need to automate marketing, manage client relationships, and grow their practice efficiently. Why Lawyers Choose HubSpot: HubSpot empowers law firms to automate client communication while maintaining the personal touch that builds trust and generates referrals. The platform enables lawyers to focus on billable work while sophisticated automation nurtures leads, updates clients, and maintains relationships with referral sources.

  Buyer personas are a foundational component of many brands’ marketing strategy. Personas often serve as a blueprint that guides marketing campaigns, customer journeys, and even product development.  Even though buyer personas are highly effective, they often miss the helpful context that marketers need to effectively serve the various identities their ideal customers possess. As a result, personas aren’t converting certain consumers at the rates that they could be. In this post, I’ll share where traditional buyer personas miss the mark and how to fix it. Table of Contents Organize your audience segments and make your marketing stronger. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. As an inclusive marketing strategist and consultant, I work with my clients to audit various components of their customer experience. This often includes reviewing and providing feedback on their creative briefs as they work on creating campaigns. It also involves getting consumer feedback on what they make. Whenever I flag materials that can be improved regarding consumers with specific identities, brands have included specific buyer personas in their creative brief.  However, the execution of the materials wasn’t as successful. That’s often because the personas lacked the depth of information about the various identities of the consumers that the brand wanted to reach. And as a result, the corresponding campaigns often fail to effectively engage consumers who are part of underrepresented and underserved communities that also fit the buyer persona profile. That’s a missed opportunity. Getting it right makes buyers feel seen, supported, and like they belong. Here are some examples of challenges that arise with personas that lack specificity. I should note that these are all complaints I’ve heard directly or seen consumers commenting on in various channels:  Every consumer has identities that influence what they buy and who they buy from, whether they know it or not. For instance, I’m a Black woman. I’m left-handed. I follow a gluten-free diet for health reasons. My husband is a Spanish-speaking immigrant. And, together, we have a mixed-race bilingual child. As both a consumer and a business owner, at least one of these aspects of my identity influences what I buy in more instances than not. For example, as a business owner, I often look for success stories from other business owners who “look like me.” After relocating to the U.S. from Buenos Aires, when we went to buy a car, my husband and I chose our salesperson based on whether or not they spoke Spanish. When I buy clothes, dolls, and toys for my daughter, I intentionally look for options where the images reflect girls who have curly hair and match her skin tone. Other consumers don’t have the choice of considering their identity when it comes to making buying decisions. That’s because societal influences shape their experiences. How others respond to and/or engage with them is different. That’s especially true when compared to others who fit what has traditionally been considered the “mainstream.” To illustrate, I worked with a client who had both service providers and the end consumers in their customer base. During research, we often heard from service providers that aspects of their identity (including race/ethnicity and gender) impacted the way they were treated while doing their work. The service providers’ identities did not impact how well they were able to perform at their craft. But, their identities sometimes impacted the kinds of experiences they had with others. That wasn’t the case for people with identities that were part of the “mainstream”. As consumers, our identities are a core part of who we are. Most consumers don’t compartmentalize or separate their identities when it comes to the buying process — even if marketers aren’t necessarily considering or infusing identity effectively into personas. For buyers, their identity is so ingrained that they might not even realize how much it is a part of their decision-making process. And if marketers don’t ask about it during research, their identities may never come up as a point of consideration. Therein lies the disconnect between many buyer personas and the consumers they are intended to represent. Marketers must remember that the customers they serve are both consciously and unconsciously looking to answer this fundamental question when engaging with your brand: Is this product for someone like me? That someone like me could be a variety of things: And the list goes on and on. If a consumer doesn’t feel like what you have to offer is for “someone like them,” they will move on to something or someone else. Brands face a challenge: They must clearly and quickly communicate that their offering is for the specific identities of people who face the problem they solve. To meet this need, marketers need to call out those identities and acknowledge them in personas. So even though a neurodivergent consumer fits one of your buyer persona categories to a tee, that doesn’t mean he will feel seen, supported, or like he belongs with your brand. That’s especially true if your personas don't mention any aspects of his identity. One of the core tenets of customer acquisition is choosing the specific identities you want to serve as customers. By infusing those identities into your buyer personas, you’ll set your brand up with the foundation needed to effectively serve all the consumers you want to target. There are two ways you can approach this. This involves taking your existing personas and adding more of the identity-based context. The extra information will help marketers execute on campaigns. It's always a good idea when data can inform the identity-based layers you want to include. So whatever data you can access about your ideal consumers from an identity standpoint, dig into it. If you can’t access that data from your own internal or third-party data sources, consider sourcing this type of information from surveys, 1:1 interviews, or other direct engagements. That way, you can start to build the layers of the identities into your buyer persona profiles. Once you have more specifics about what the identities are, be intentional about clearly and quickly communicating that what you have to offer is “for people like them” throughout your customer journey. Here’s what adding in more identity-based information could look like for Creator Carmen.    These facts alone might be helpful to include in the narrative. But if a marketing team doesn’t know how being visually impaired, an Afro-Latina, or speaking English with a Spanish preference potentially influences Carmen, that information isn’t useful. Marketers need to understand how identity factors impact these three versions of Creator Carmen’s decision-making process and buyer journey. My recommendation is to infuse more nuanced information into your personas like this:  Then, supplement your identity-related challenges, frustrations, and wishes with supporting documentation. The extra information serves as a guidebook of what’s different about Creator Carmen’s experiences because of her disability versus a Creator Carmen who doesn’t have one. You can then show up well for the various versions of Creator Carmen you want to reach. Customer interviews, focus groups, social listening, and other secondary sources can help you gain the cultural intelligence you need about identity. You might find that there are times when having a buyer persona specific to certain identities is helpful. However, the success of a persona depends on what your suite of buyer personas looks like or how they’re categorized. This works well in the instances where it’s necessary to create specific products, features, communications, experiences, and even core messaging. For instance, let's say one of your product offers includes a customer segment of children under the age of 18. The needs, experiences, expectations, and ethics associated with how a brand communicates with them would be sufficiently different. With these constraints, it could be harder to make personas with identity-specific layers. Here’s another example for you. In this video, email marketing strategist Eman Ismail explains how her Muslim faith identity has impacted her experiences at business events. Brands that host any kind of event and want to create a space where Muslim attendees feel seen, supported, and like they belong could benefit from creating a separate identity-specific persona. You can listen to my entire conversation with Eman here on this episode of the Inclusion & Marketing podcast. 00:00/00:00 Buyer personas are powerful, but only when you create them to operate at their full potential. Move beyond traditional buyer personas to incorporate important elements of identity that your ideal customers are using to make buying decisions. The payoff: more authentic campaigns, more conversions, and greater impact. Organize your audience segments and make your marketing stronger. All fields are required.

Email platforms enable systematic lead nurturing that keeps prospects engaged throughout the extended automotive sales cycle, which averages 90-120 days. Automated follow-up sequences deliver relevant content, vehicle information, and promotional offers at optimal intervals, increasing lead-to-sale conversion rates. Email marketing maintains ongoing relationships with customers between service visits and vehicle purchases, increasing retention and repeat business. Automotive businesses utilizing strategic email campaigns experience significant increases in customer lifetime value through enhanced service appointment adherence, increased accessory sales, and optimized vehicle trade-in timing. Modern email platforms offer detailed analytics that show which campaigns generate appointments, sales, and revenue, enabling evidence-based budget allocation. Automotive businesses replace guesswork with concrete metrics, including open rates, click-through rates, conversion tracking, and revenue attribution that prove marketing ROI to stakeholders. Email software enables automotive businesses to communicate with thousands of customers simultaneously at a fraction of the cost of traditional direct mail. Platforms enable personalized messaging at scale, where each recipient receives content relevant to their vehicle, service history, and preferences while maintaining operational efficiency. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Document all current customer touchpoints, including initial inquiries, test drive follow-ups, purchase confirmations, service reminders, maintenance notifications, trade-in alerts, and loyalty communications. Identify which communications are currently handled manually and which could benefit from automation. Understanding your complete communication ecosystem reveals which platform features will deliver the most significant operational impact and efficiency gains. Determine essential features based on your automotive business model. Dealerships prioritize CRM integration, lead scoring, and inventory-based segmentation. Repair shops require service reminder automation and appointment booking integration. Parts retailers need e-commerce features and product recommendation engines. Create a prioritized feature list that distinguishes between absolute requirements and nice-to-have capabilities to guide platform evaluation. Evaluate your team's marketing technology experience and available training time. Platforms like Constant Contact and AWeber suit teams with limited technical skills, as they prefer intuitive interfaces. ActiveCampaign and HubSpot offer more advanced capabilities but require a higher level of expertise. Test platform interfaces during free trials to assess whether team members can independently create campaigns without extensive ongoing support. Calculate the total cost of ownership as your contact list grows. Some platforms charge per contact while others charge per email sent, creating dramatically different cost structures at scale. Project your list size 12-24 months into the future and calculate pricing based on that volume. Include costs for required add-ons, such as SMS messaging, additional users, or advanced features that may necessitate tier upgrades. Select a platform that scales with your business growth without requiring disruptive migrations. HubSpot supports automotive businesses from startup through enterprise scale with a unified platform that eliminates the need for multiple disconnected tools. The platform's free tier enables businesses to start immediately with email marketing and CRM, then seamlessly upgrade to marketing automation, sales enablement, and customer service features as needs evolve without data migration. Define the specific goal for each campaign before building content. Common automotive objectives include generating service appointments, promoting vehicle inventory, announcing sales events, nurturing new leads, reactivating dormant customers, or encouraging referrals. Clear objectives guide content creation, call-to-action selection, and success metrics that determine campaign effectiveness. Divide your contact list into targeted groups based on vehicle ownership, purchase history, service needs, and engagement levels. Effective segments include customers due for service, recent vehicle purchasers, leads interested in specific vehicle types, customers with vehicles over 100,000 miles, and high-engagement email subscribers. Segmented campaigns generate 58% higher open rates than generic broadcasts. Build email templates that display properly on smartphones since 61% of automotive emails are opened on mobile devices. Use single-column layouts, large tap-friendly buttons, concise subject lines under 40 characters, and clear calls-to-action above the fold. Test emails across multiple devices and email clients before sending to ensure consistent rendering. Craft subject lines that immediately communicate value and relevance to recipients. Effective automotive subject lines include specific benefits, create urgency, personalize with vehicle information, or ask questions that spark curiosity. Preview text should complement the subject line by providing additional context that encourages opens. Direct recipients toward a single primary action per email, such as scheduling a service appointment, viewing vehicle inventory, claiming a promotional offer, or reading educational content. Place primary calls-to-action prominently, using contrasting button colors and action-oriented text such as “Schedule Service,” “View Inventory,” or “Claim Offer.” Configure triggered follow-up emails based on recipient behavior. Send reminder emails to non-openers after 2-3 days with different subject lines. Follow up on email clicks with additional information related to the content that was clicked. Create abandoned booking sequences when customers start but don't complete appointment scheduling, recovering 15-25% of incomplete bookings. Track key metrics including open rates, click-through rates, conversion rates, unsubscribe rates, and revenue generated. Compare campaign performance against automotive industry benchmarks of 22% open rates and 2.5% click-through rates. Identify top-performing subject lines, content types, and send times, then replicate successful elements in future campaigns while testing continuous improvements. HubSpot is the ideal email marketing tool for automotive businesses because it combines email marketing, CRM, marketing automation, and sales enablement into a single, integrated platform. HubSpot enables automotive businesses to manage complete customer lifecycles from initial inquiry through vehicle purchase and ongoing service appointments without switching between disconnected systems. The platform‘s free tier includes unlimited contacts, email marketing, forms, landing pages, and CRM functionality, making it accessible for businesses of any size. Multi-location dealership groups benefit from HubSpot’s attribution reporting, which connects marketing campaigns directly to vehicle sales and service revenue, thereby proving ROI. Automotive businesses should prioritize service reminder automation, CRM integration, vehicle-based segmentation, lead scoring, mobile optimization, workflow automation, landing page builders, A/B testing, SMS integration, and revenue attribution in email marketing tools. Service reminder automation ensures customers receive timely maintenance notifications based on purchase dates and mileage intervals without manual intervention. CRM integration syncs customer data between email platforms and dealership management systems, eliminating duplicate data entry and ensuring information accuracy. Vehicle-based segmentation enables targeted campaigns by make, model, year, and service history for relevant messaging. Lead scoring automatically prioritizes hot prospects based on engagement patterns, helping sales teams focus efforts efficiently. Mobile optimization is essential since 61% of automotive emails are opened on smartphones. HubSpot is excellent for automotive businesses because it provides a unified platform that manages marketing, sales, and customer service in one system, specifically designed for managing long customer lifecycles. Automotive businesses benefit from HubSpot‘s free CRM that tracks every customer interaction from initial website visit through vehicle purchase and ongoing service appointments. The platform’s marketing automation enables sophisticated workflows for service reminders, lead nurturing, and customer retention campaigns, eliminating the need for technical expertise. HubSpot‘s closed-loop reporting shows which marketing campaigns generate actual vehicle sales and service appointments, enabling data-driven budget allocation. Service departments reduced no-show rates by using HubSpot’s automated reminder campaigns. Single-location dealerships start with HubSpot's permanently free tier, while multi-location groups leverage enterprise features that scale with business growth. Email marketing software for automotive businesses costs between $ 0 and $3,600+ per month, depending on the contact list size, required features, and business scale. Most platforms offer free tiers that support 250-1,000 contacts, with basic email and automation features sufficient for small repair shops and single-location dealerships. Entry-level paid plans cost $12-$ 29 monthly for businesses with fewer than 1,000 contacts that need templates and basic automation. Mid-market automotive businesses with 2,500-5,000 contacts and marketing automation requirements typically spend between $50 and $ 200 per month. Enterprise dealership groups with 10,000+ contacts and advanced needs, including lead scoring, revenue attribution, and API integrations, invest $500-3,600+ monthly. Pricing structures vary significantly: some platforms charge per contact while others charge per email sent, making cost comparison essential before selection. Automotive businesses improve email deliverability by using double opt-in confirmation, maintaining list hygiene through regular removal of inactive subscribers, authenticating email domains with SPF and DKIM records, avoiding spam trigger words in subject lines, sending consistent email volumes, segmenting lists for relevance, and monitoring bounce rates. Email platforms with robust deliverability infrastructure maintain strong relationships with major inbox providers and proactively monitor sender reputations. Automotive businesses should strive for inbox placement rates above 95% and maintain spam complaint rates below 0.1% by sending emails only to customers who have explicitly opted in and providing clear value in every communication. HubSpot delivers the most comprehensive email marketing solution for automotive businesses by unifying marketing automation, CRM, sales enablement, and customer service in one integrated platform. Over 184,000 businesses across 120 countries trust HubSpot to manage their complete customer lifecycle without requiring multiple disconnected tools that create data silos and operational inefficiencies.

  Running a successful dental practice requires more than fluoride, free toothbrushes, and clinical expertise. Between managing patient appointments, following up on treatment plans, and regulatory concerns, dental practices face unique marketing challenges, and analog outreach methods often fall short of tackling them.  Thankfully, email marketing offers a scalable channel to stay top-of-mind, educate patients, and boost retention across hygiene, referrals, or specialty procedures by automating appointment reminders, personalizing treatment follow-ups, and segmenting patients based on their dental health needs. In fact, the average email open rate for dental practices hovers around 40%, showing email marketing is a highly effective avenue in the industry. But where do you start? This article provides a comprehensive comparison of email marketing solutions built for dental practices (including HubSpot). You'll find detailed feature breakdowns, verified pricing information, a side-by-side comparison, and a step-by-step guide to choosing the right platform. Table of Contents Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for dentists enables dental practices to send digital targeted messages to patients and prospects. This includes appointment reminders, treatment follow-ups, recall notifications for cleanings (all with HIPAA compliance), oral health education, and promotional campaigns for cosmetic procedures. Email marketing helps dental practices maintain consistent patient engagement while reducing no-shows and increasing treatment acceptance rates. Email marketing software addresses critical challenges dental practices face in patient communication and practice growth. Here's how the right platform transforms dental practice operations: Organizing patients by treatment needs, demographics, visit history, or engagement behavior helps you better target your contacts with messaging that truly resonates and drives action. HubSpot's advanced segmentation allow dental practices to create both static and dynamic patient lists that you can use to promote things like orthodontic services to families with teenagers, cosmetic procedures to adults aged 35-55, or dental implant consultations to seniors. In fact, companies have cut their time creating lists and segmenting contacts by 50% using HubSpot. However, it’s important to note that your email marketing tool must be HIPAA-compliant (like HubSpot) to target and email patients based on any health or medical history data. (More on this shortly.) Automated appointment reminders (like the one below) significantly decrease missed appointments, which cost dental practices an average of $150-200 per occurrence in lost revenue and schedule disruptions.  Appointment reminder workflows with a HIPAA-compliant tool like HubSpot can integrate with practice management systems to automatically send confirmation emails upon booking, followed by strategically timed reminders at 48 hours and 24 hours before appointments. Appointment reminders have been shown to reduce no-shows by up to 40%. Regular communication keeps patients engaged between visits, encourages consistent preventive care, and builds camaraderie, directly impacting practice revenue and patient health outcomes. Dental practices can send care tips, team updates, host contests, or even send birthday wishes like the orthodontist below:  Educational email campaigns that explain procedures, address common concerns, and showcase results can help patients feel more confident about recommended treatments , particularly high-cost ones like implants or cosmetic work. Here's an example of a newsletter from the same orthodonist:  HubSpot Content and Marketing hubs can aid the delivery of this kind of content through automated drip emails. Practices can share targeted educational content, patient testimonials, and even financing information, all of which can help patients make more informed purchase decisions. Automating routine communications frees up staff time previously spent making phone calls and sending manual reminders, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities like in-office patient care. HubSpot's versatile workflows, for example, can automate consistent, transactional communication (e.g., appointment confirmations, pre-appointment instructions, and insurance reminders) thanks to its HIPAA compliance without requiring staff intervention. This reduces administrative burden while improving communication consistency and timeliness. When evaluating email marketing platforms for your dental practice, prioritize these essential features that directly impact patient communication effectiveness and practice growth: Protecting patient information is legally mandatory for dental practices and any healthcare providers under HIPAA regulations. And a lot of email initiatives like appointment reminders and campaigns based on patient history depend on this. To be HIPAA-compliant, email platforms must maintain specific security standards and sign Business Associate Agreements to send messages including or relating to protected health information (PHI).  Source HubSpot offers Business Associate Agreements for enterprise-level plans and maintains the security infrastructure necessary to communicate patient information safely (i.e. encryption, access controls, and audit logging). Note: HIPAA compliance is unnecessary for sending general marketing emails that do not include specific health information. The ability to automatically send pre-appointment reminders at strategic intervals reduces no-shows, improves schedule efficiency, and eliminates staff time spent making manual reminder calls. HubSpot's automated emails integrate seamlessly with practice management systems like Dentrix and Eaglesoft, so practices can trigger confirmation emails upon booking, followed by reminders at 48 hours, 24 hours, and even same-day. Your HubSpot emails can also include personalization, such as patient names, appointment times, and specific pre-appointment instructions for different procedure types. Grouping patients by treatment history, age, last visit date, procedure interest, insurance status, or engagement behavior enables targeted, relevant communication that drives higher engagement and conversion rates (though this requires HIPAA compliance). For instance, perhaps you could send emails about braces to preteen patients or resources on denture care to elderly patients. HubSpot's segmentation tools allow dental practices to create patient lists based on multiple criteria. Dynamic lists can also automatically refresh segments as patient data changes.  Source Read: Customer Segmentation: How to Segment Users & Clients Effectively Over 60% of emails are opened on mobile devices, making mobile optimization essential for ensuring appointment details, treatment information, and practice updates display correctly and remain actionable on smartphones and tablets. Great email marketing tools like HubSpot provide mobile-optimized templates specifically designed for healthcare communications. HubSpot’s drag-and-drop editing ensures any staff member can create professional, mobile-friendly emails without coding skills, while its preview tools show exactly how emails appear across different devices before sending. Check out HubSpot’s free email templates. Testing different subject lines, send times, content variations, and calls-to-action helps optimize email performance and identify what resonates best with your specific patient base. HubSpot's built-in A/B testing allows dental practices to experiment with up to five variations simultaneously, automatically determining winning versions based on open rates, click rates, or custom goals. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Bidirectional data flow between email marketing and scheduling systems prevents duplicate data entry, ensures patient information stays synchronized, and enables automation based on practice management system events like appointments, completed treatments, or outstanding balances. HubSpot connects with leading dental practice management platforms, including Dentrix, Eaglesoft, Open Dental, and Curve, through native integrations and API connections. This allows it to automatically synchronize patient demographics, appointment history, and treatment information to enable sophisticated segmentation and personalization without manual data exports. Understanding which campaigns drive results helps refine marketing strategy and justify marketing spend to practice owners and stakeholders. HubSpot's analytics dashboard can track email opens, clicks, appointment bookings, and revenue attribution with clear visualization, providing visibility into which campaigns generate the highest ROI, which patient segments are most responsive, and how email marketing contributes to overall practice growth.

Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Selecting the right email marketing platform ensures your dental practice communicates effectively with patients while supporting practice growth goals. Follow these steps to make an informed decision: Begin by documenting every patient touchpoint from initial inquiry through ongoing care, identifying which communications happen manually today that could be automated. Common dental practice workflows include: Understanding your complete communication flow helps identify which platform features matter most for your specific practice needs. Remember, any transactional emails related to your contact’s health require a HIPAA-compliant tool — that includes appointment reminders. Only general marketing emails like blog articles, promotions, holiday greetings, etc., can be sent without this compliance. It is common to use multiple tools to cover all your bases, but HIPAA-compliant tools like HubSpot streamline your email marketing toolbox to just one. Based on your workflow map, prioritize essential capabilities to reap the most immediate value to your practice. Most dental practices require appointment reminder automation to reduce no-shows, patient segmentation to enable targeted messaging, mobile-responsive templates for optimal viewing on all devices, and integration with existing practice management software to avoid duplicate data entry. Determine whether you need advanced features like SMS capabilities for multi-channel reminders, webinar hosting for patient education, sophisticated patient journey automation for complex treatment nurturing, or e-commerce functionality if selling oral care products. HubSpot provides comprehensive features that address common dental practice needs including automation, segmentation, integrations, and analytics without requiring multiple disconnected tools. Consider who will manage email marketing in your practice (i.e. front desk staff, marketing coordinator, or practice manager) and their comfort with learning new technology. Work with them to test free trials and demos to see how quickly they can create campaigns, set up automation workflows, and interpret results without help. The ideal platform enables existing staff to execute marketing initiatives easily and without consistent support. HubSpot's intuitive drag-and-drop interface, thorough documentation, support, and training courses in HubSpot Academy allow dental teams to become proficient quickly, even without previous marketing technology experience. Compare pricing as your patient database grows. Many platforms appear affordable at low contact volumes but become expensive as your practice expands. Factor in costs for additional features like extra user seats, email volume limits and overage charges, SMS messaging credits, and integration costs for connecting practice management software. Consider the value of integrated functionality versus purchasing separate tools for CRM, landing pages, automation, and analytics, which adds complexity and total cost. HubSpot's transparent pricing structure and included features often prove more cost-effective than piecing together multiple solutions, particularly when accounting for staff time spent managing disconnected systems. Select a platform that scales with your practice and adapts to changing marketing needs rather than one you'll quickly outgrow. HubSpot serves dental practices ranging from solo practitioners just starting with email marketing to multi-location groups with sophisticated patient acquisition funnels. Dental practices implementing HubSpot report 25% improvement in new patient appointments within the first six months and a 40% increase in positive reviews, demonstrating the platform's effectiveness for dental-specific communication needs and patient relationship management. Successfully implementing email marketing requires strategic planning and consistent execution. If you’re just getting started, here are some basic steps you can follow to set up a basic email marketing campaign for a dental practice. Refine as needed for your specific goal and messaging. Establish clear, measurable goals for each email campaign before creating content. This gives you direction and something to help you evaluate how you’re doing. Common dental practice objectives include: HubSpot's campaign management tools (and HIPAA compliance) enable setting specific goals like appointment bookings or consultation requests, tracking performance against those targets in real-time, and calculating ROI by attributing revenue directly to specific campaigns. Organize your patient database into groups based on shared characteristics or behaviors. This could mean last visit date, age group, treatment history, geographic location, insurance status, and engagement level to identify potential campaign ideas and improve relevance and response rates. HubSpot's sophisticated list features enable complex filtering. Dynamic lists even automatically update as patient data changes, ensuring segments stay current without manual maintenance. Create visually appealing, on-brand emails that display correctly and remain functional across all devices, particularly smartphones, where most people read email. Include clear, easy-to-click calls-to-action, use concise copy that communicates value quickly since patients scan rather than read thoroughly, incorporate practice branding elements like logos and colors for consistency and recognition, and optimize images to load quickly even on slower mobile connections. HubSpot's drag-and-drop email builder includes a library of mobile-responsive templates specifically designed for healthcare providers. This allows even non-technical staff to create professional emails, while also showing you a real-time preview of how the email will appear on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Set up the automated sequence that triggers your email send. This could be based on patient actions, practice management system events, or time intervals, ensuring communication without any additional manual effort. HubSpot's visual workflow builder makes it simple to design, test, and launch sequences with drag-and-drop logic. Customize email content using available patient information to increase relevance, engagement, and response rates through targeted messaging. Include patient first names, sure, but also go beyond that. Reference their specific upcoming appointments with date, time, and provider details, mention their treatment history to acknowledge ongoing care relationships, recommend services based on previous procedures or stated interests, and adjust messaging tone based on patient demographics like age or family status. Modern buyers are savvy to “first name” personalization tokens, but incorporating deeper details cut through the noise. They make your emails feel like they were actually written specifically for that person. (This is an important piece of Loop Marketing). In addition to HubSpot's personalization tokens, it’s smart content features can display entirely different content blocks to different segments within the same email campaign. Continuously improve email effectiveness through systematic testing of different elements like subject line, call-to-action, design, and messaging. HubSpot's A/B testing capabilities allow you to test up to five variations of subject lines, content, or send times simultaneously, automatically determining winning versions and applying those insights to future campaigns for continuous improvement. Regularly review campaign metrics to understand what resonates with patients, which segments are most responsive, and how email marketing contributes to practice growth. This may include, but is not limited to: HubSpot Reporting consolidates these metrics into visual charts and graphs, enables filtering by segment or campaign type to identify patterns, and provides year-over-year comparison showing growth in email marketing effectiveness over time. The best tool depends on your specific needs, but with its comprehensive suite of integrated marketing and business growth tools and HIPAA compliance alongside its email offerings, HubSpot is hard to top. It combines powerful automation, sophisticated patient segmentation, and practice management integration in one unified platform rather than requiring multiple disconnected tools and protecting patient data. What features should I look for in Email Marketing Tools for Dentists? Essential features for dental email marketing include: HubSpot delivers all these features in a unified platform with transparent pricing, eliminating the need for multiple disconnected tools that create data silos and complicate operations. Yes, HubSpot is excellent for dental practices of all sizes seeking comprehensive patient communication and practice growth solutions that go beyond basic email marketing. The platform serves solo practitioners just starting with digital marketing, growing practices ready for automation and segmentation, and multi-location dental groups requiring sophisticated patient journey management, with scalable features that adapt to specific needs and practice size. Many dental practices report significant improvements in patient retention rates, treatment acceptance for high-value procedures, operational efficiency through automation, and overall practice growth after implementing HubSpot for their email marketing and patient relationship management needs. Email marketing software pricing for dental practices ranges from free plans with basic features to enterprise solutions costing several thousand dollars monthly, with pricing typically based on contact database size, number of email sends, and feature sophistication. HubSpot offers flexible pricing starting with a completely free CRM including basic email marketing suitable for practices just beginning digital communication. Paid plans start at $15 a month. Absolutely. Email marketing significantly reduces no-show rates through appointment reminders sent at strategic intervals before scheduled visits, addressing one of dental practices' most costly operational challenges. Research indicates that practices using automated email reminders reduce no-shows by 30-50% compared to relying solely on phone calls or no reminders, translating to thousands of dollars in recovered revenue monthly for typical practices. HubSpot's appointment reminder workflows integrate with practice management systems to automatically send multiple touchpoints. HubSpot stands out as the premier email marketing solution for dental practices seeking to transform patient communication and accelerate practice growth through sophisticated yet accessible marketing technology. Unlike specialized email tools that require separate systems for patient tracking, scheduling coordination, and analytics, or basic tools that lack the automation capabilities dental practices need, HIPAA-compliant HubSpot provides a unified platform that streamlines all aspects of patient engagement while maintaining complete visibility into marketing effectiveness and ROI. Key HubSpot Features for Dental Practices: Dental practices using HubSpot's email marketing platform experience 25% more new patient appointments within the first year. Ready to see how HubSpot can work for your dental practice? Get started with HubSpot today and transform how you connect with patients, fill your schedule, and grow your practice through strategic, automated email marketing that delivers measurable results. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email Marketing

  Higher education institutions face unique communication challenges in 2025. Between recruiting prospective students, engaging current learners, maintaining alumni relationships, and coordinating with faculty, colleges and universities need robust email marketing solutions that can handle complex, multi-audience campaigns while delivering personalized experiences at scale.  Email marketing remains the most preferred communication channel for prospective students during the college application process, with 55% preferring email over text messages (33%). The education industry also achieves an average email open rate of 28.5% — among the highest across all sectors — making email marketing an essential tool for enrollment management and student engagement. This guide compares the best email marketing software for higher education institutions in 2025, including detailed feature breakdowns, pricing information, and recommendations to help you choose the right platform for your college or university. Table of Contents Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Email marketing for higher education is a strategic communication approach that colleges and universities use to connect with prospective students, current students, alumni, donors, and faculty through targeted email campaigns. Email marketing enables institutions to nurture leads through the enrollment funnel, share important academic updates, promote campus events, and maintain long-term relationships with their community while tracking engagement and measuring campaign effectiveness.

Here are the six best solutions tailored for higher education needs.  HubSpot is best for: Universities seeking an all-in-one CRM and marketing automation platform with advanced analytics HubSpot provides higher education institutions with a comprehensive platform that unifies marketing, admissions, and student service processes.

Key Mailchimp Features: Mailchimp Pricing:  Best For: Colleges and universities that regularly host campus events and need integrated event management Constant Contact specializes in event marketing tools alongside traditional email marketing features, making it valuable for institutions that coordinate open houses, alumni events, webinars, and campus tours. Key Constant Contact Features: Constant Contact Pricing: Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT.

Key Envoke Features: Envoke Pricing: Email marketing platforms deliver measurable advantages that directly support enrollment goals and student engagement objectives. Email marketing software enables institutions to automate prospect nurture campaigns from inquiry through enrollment. Universities using marketing automation track prospective students through each stage of the enrollment funnel, automatically sending relevant content based on application status and demonstrated interests. This systematic approach increases conversion rates while reducing manual workload for admissions staff. Higher education institutions serve diverse audiences with varying needs—prospective undergraduates, graduate students, international applicants, transfer students, alumni, and parents each require tailored messaging. Email marketing platforms segment contacts based on dozens of attributes and behaviors, enabling institutions to deliver personalized content to thousands of recipients simultaneously. In a 2024 EAB study, 93% of students said that receiving a personalized message from a college would encourage them to explore a school further. Email marketing software provides detailed analytics on campaign performance, including open rates, click-through rates, and conversion metrics. Higher education marketing teams use this data to identify which messages resonate with prospective students, which recruitment channels generate the highest-quality leads, and how marketing efforts directly contribute to enrollment numbers. This visibility enables institutions to allocate budgets more effectively and demonstrate marketing ROI to leadership. Email marketing platforms help institutions maintain long-term relationships with alumni through targeted communications about networking events, donation campaigns, and career opportunities. Automated workflows enable universities to send personalized birthday messages, graduation anniversary emails, and updates about developments in alumni's fields of study, strengthening lifetime connections to the institution. For university systems with multiple campuses or online programs, email marketing software ensures consistent branding while allowing customization for local audiences. Centralized platforms enable marketing teams to create templates that individual campuses can personalize with location-specific details, events, and program information. When evaluating email marketing platforms for your college or university, prioritize these essential capabilities. Selecting the right email marketing platform requires careful evaluation of your institution's specific needs and growth plans. Document all email communications your institution currently sends including prospective student nurture campaigns, current student updates, alumni newsletters, event promotions, and internal communications. Identify which workflows are manual versus automated, where bottlenecks occur, and which messages achieve the highest engagement. This assessment reveals which platform features will deliver the most value. List the essential capabilities your institution requires such as CRM integration, automation complexity, segmentation depth, event management, SMS capabilities, or analytics sophistication. Determine which systems the email platform must integrate with including your student information system, admissions CRM, event management tools, and payment processors. Prioritize features that directly support enrollment goals or significantly reduce staff workload. Evaluate how intuitive each platform is for your team's skill level. Request demos or trials to test the email builder, automation workflow creator, and reporting interface. Consider whether your team will need extensive training or can start using the platform immediately. Assess whether the platform requires technical expertise or offers visual, drag-and-drop interfaces accessible to non-technical users. Look beyond starting prices to estimate costs as your contact database grows. Factor in the number of contacts you'll manage in 1-2 years, expected email send volumes, additional features you may need later, and costs for add-ons like SMS marketing or premium support. Some platforms charge based on contacts while others charge based on email sends; determine which pricing model aligns better with your usage patterns. Select a platform that can scale with your institution's growth and adapt to evolving communication strategies. HubSpot enables higher education institutions to centralize marketing, admissions, and student service processes in one powerful CRM platform. The University of Wyoming leveraged HubSpot's flexible platform to grow from basic email campaigns to sophisticated marketing automation that increased lead volume by 26% and conversion rates to 18% year-over-year while providing the data-driven insights needed to justify marketing investments to leadership. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Developing effective email campaigns requires strategic planning and thoughtful execution. Establish specific, measurable objectives for each campaign such as increasing information session registrations by 20%, improving application completion rates by 15%, or driving 500 prospective students to specific landing pages. Identify the precise audience segment that should receive the campaign including characteristics like prospective undergraduate versus graduate students, specific program interests, geographic regions, and current stage in the enrollment journey. Create subject lines that clearly communicate value and create urgency without resorting to spam trigger words. Incorporate personalization tokens like recipient name, program of interest, or application deadline. Write preview text that complements the subject line by providing additional context or reinforcing the call to action. Test multiple subject line variations to identify which approaches generate the highest open rates among higher education audiences. Build email templates with single-column layouts that adapt seamlessly to mobile screens. Use clear hierarchy with prominent headlines, concise body text, and obvious call-to-action buttons. Limit image file sizes to ensure fast loading on mobile devices. Preview emails on multiple devices and email clients before sending to verify proper rendering. Use merge fields to insert recipient-specific information including name, program of interest, campus location, and application status. Implement conditional content that displays different sections based on recipient attributes such as showing undergraduate-specific information to undergrad prospects and graduate program details to graduate school candidates. Reference previous interactions like “Thank you for attending our virtual tour” or “We noticed you downloaded our financial aid guide.” Include a single, prominent call-to-action that aligns with your campaign goal such as “Register for an Information Session,” “Complete Your Application,” or “Schedule a Campus Visit.” Use action-oriented button text that creates urgency. Ensure CTA buttons are large enough to tap easily on mobile devices and use contrasting colors that stand out from surrounding content. Analyze historical email engagement data to identify when your audience most frequently opens and clicks emails. For higher education audiences, prospective students check email multiple times daily with 88% checking at least once per day. Consider sending emails during weekday afternoons when prospective students review college information or weekend mornings when they have more time to engage with content. Track key metrics including open rates, click-through rates, conversion rates, and unsubscribe rates. Compare performance across different audience segments to identify which messages resonate with which groups. A/B test variables like subject lines, send times, email length, and CTA placement. Use insights from each campaign to refine future messaging and improve overall effectiveness. HubSpot provides the most comprehensive solution for higher education institutions seeking to integrate marketing, admissions, and CRM capabilities in one platform. HubSpot offers free CRM functionality, advanced marketing automation, robust analytics, and seamless integration with student information systems. The University of Wyoming increased lead volume by 26% and improved conversion rates to 18% using HubSpot's platform, demonstrating measurable ROI for enrollment marketing efforts. Essential features include advanced audience segmentation to target different prospect types, behavior-based automation triggered by actions like form submissions or website visits, CRM integration to maintain complete prospect records, mobile-optimized templates to reach prospects on smartphones, detailed analytics to measure campaign effectiveness, and compliance tools to manage consent and data privacy. Additional valuable features include event management capabilities, SMS marketing for multi-channel campaigns, and A/B testing to optimize message performance. HubSpot excels for higher education institutions because it unifies marketing, admissions, and student service operations in one integrated platform. Five graduate schools at the University of San Diego replaced Salesforce with HubSpot, saving admissions teams 2-4 hours per week through automated workflows and streamlined processes. HubSpot‘s free CRM tier makes it accessible for smaller institutions while enterprise features support large university systems. The platform’s reporting capabilities enable marketing teams to demonstrate ROI by tying advertising spend directly to enrolled students, which is essential for securing continued budget support. Email marketing software pricing for higher education varies significantly based on contact list size, feature requirements, and send volumes. Entry-level plans start around $12-15 per month for 500 contacts with basic features. Mid-tier plans with automation and advanced segmentation range from $35-80 per month for 500 contacts. Enterprise solutions for large universities with tens of thousands of contacts can exceed $3,600 per month. Many platforms including HubSpot offer free plans with limited features, and numerous providers extend educational discounts to accredited institutions. Evaluate total cost of ownership including potential overages, add-on features, and integration costs. Successful higher education email marketing prioritizes personalization based on prospect interests and application stage, leverages automation to deliver timely messages at critical enrollment decision points, segments audiences to ensure relevance, optimizes for mobile devices where most emails are opened, includes clear calls-to-action that guide prospects toward next steps, tests subject lines and content variations to improve performance, monitors compliance with data privacy regulations, and measures ROI by tracking conversions from inquiry through enrollment. Since 55% of prospective students prefer email communication during the application process, maintaining consistent, valuable email touchpoints throughout the enrollment journey significantly influences enrollment decisions. HubSpot provides higher education institutions with the most comprehensive marketing, admissions, and CRM platform to attract prospective students, nurture leads through the enrollment journey, and maintain lifelong relationships with students and alumni. Why HubSpot Excels for Higher Education: Proven Results in Higher Education: The University of Wyoming increased lead volume by 26% and improved conversion rates to 18% year-over-year using HubSpot‘s marketing automation and analytics. The university leveraged HubSpot’s dashboard capabilities to demonstrate to leadership how marketing investments translated directly into enrolled students.

  Building a business has never been easier, but the landscape is also more competitive. The difference between success and failure often comes down to how quickly you can execute. You need to understand your market and know how to scale your operations. AI tools can help you get off the ground.  If I had to rebuild my business from scratch today, I'd lean heavily into AI tools to make the process faster, smarter, and more efficient than ever before. Here‘s exactly how I’d approach rebuilding from zero, and the specific AI tools that would make it possible. Table of Contents Every entrepreneur needs to know their niche. If you don’t have a unique angle, you’ll never stand out in the crowded market. So, you need to be specific. I'd approach it like a research sprint using AI tools to cut through the noise and find real opportunities. AI tools allow you to organize and vet your ideas. You can start a conversation with ChatGPT or OpenAI’s advanced voice mode and flesh out all your different ideas through the discussion. I would ask things like: This lets you freeflow. Later, you’ll have the conversation saved in your ChatGPT dashboard, so you can look back at the conclusions. Next, tell it to summarize what you’ve discussed and give you a list of the top ten ideas for cool companies. From there, you can use other AI tools to research and validate your ideas. My Next Wave co-host Nathan Lands adds a spin to this approach. He says, “I would go do some Perplexity searches and see if there are existing companies in the areas that I’m interested in.” Look at the websites of those companies and copy/paste them into ChatGPT to start your research into industries you’re not familiar with. This practical guide reveals where to start, which applications deliver real value, and how to implement agents that transform workflows without replacing jobs. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Once you’ve got a list of your top ten business ideas, you’ll need to test those ideas with an audience to see which one sticks. To do that, I suggest a tool like Mixo, which can rapidly build a website with a single prompt. With Mixo, you can create a few test sites that you can show to a focus group. You can show potential buyers a real mockup to see what they’re more likely to spend money on. The steps below can help you get started. Now that you have the idea, it’s time to build out relevant features. Whatever you decide to build, you’ll want to use AI to analyze the features that should be included or excluded. To start, I recommend finding products that already exist that are close to your idea. You can then riff off of them to build yours. Here’s the step-by-step process. If I were starting a new business now, I would focus on content creation. There’s more opportunity than ever to influence LLMs and dominate AI overviews with specific, bottom-of-the-funnel keywords. AI can help you create the content you need to get in front of your customer — wherever they’re at. Here’s how I would do it: Building a business used to require massive upfront investment, months of development, and teams of specialists. Today, you can validate an idea, build a working prototype, and start acquiring customers faster than ever before — if you know which tools to use. Let’s dive deep into the tools I find most helpful.  Perplexity is a large language model, like ChatGPT or Claude, but it also searches the internet whenever you ask it a question. I find Perplexity’s informed responses hard to beat. You can ask Perplexity what people are searching for right now, what they’re struggling with, or what content they want. This will help you zero in on a niche where you can make an impact. You can also use Perplexity to find information that web scraping tools can’t get to. If there’s nothing on the website to scrape, it finds reviews from Reddit or TechCrunch, and then tells me what the tool is all about. I’ve used this process to discover product details for my we,bsite Future Tools. If you’re launching a new business, these three software create the perfect tech stack. You can build a product, create a website, and keep everything up-to-date easily.  Source It all starts with Cursor, an AI code editor that can help you build your software faster. The biggest benefit? Cursor uses your entire code base for context, so the output is accurate and integrates into the larger system. With retrieval augmented generation (RAG), Cursor looks through the text of all your uploaded files and uses that information to complete the code and improve accuracy in the software you're creating. Now, you need to build a website that attracts buyers and keeps customers in the loop about your offering. Replit moves you from idea to website, all with AI. Replit’s Cursor integration allows you to automatically link any product changes to your website, eliminating any duplicate work.  Source Replit manages the front end, and Firebase takes care of the backend. Firebase can help handle your hosting and keep your databases organized.

Source So, with Cursor to write the code, Replit to host the front end, and Firebase to host the back end, you’ve got an integrated AI approach for building your business.  NotebookLM is an AI research assistant that can read your sources and help you write, summarize, and brainstorm all in one place. ⁠ I use this to get breakdowns of complex academic papers so I can quickly and easily understand the information. NotebookLM can also create mini-podcasts from the documents. I can use those summaries later when creating my own content. AI can help you in every step of building your business. But, your human presence and brand are still essential. As people are inundated with AI-generated content and avatars, they’ll look for real humans. When I click on a YouTube video and hear an AI voiceover, I hit the back button immediately because I assume it’s low-effort content. I want to hear a human explain things to me. So, you need to showcase your real voice and unique personality to build trust. Your content will need a face in content creation. They should get to know and build a bond with you personally. I keep that human element front and center at Future Tools. I personally curate every tool that goes on the site. I use AI to scrape the product details so I can easily review the tool before it goes up, but each recommendation has my authentic stamp of approval.

  The way most marketing teams approach AI is probably the way I approach my inbox at 4:59 PM on a Friday. With reckless optimism and zero follow-through. But Katie Miserany, SurveyMonkey's Chief Communication Officer and SVP of Marketing, thinks the real problem isn't AI — it's that most marketers have forgotten a fundamental truth: Just because you can talk about something doesn't mean you should.   Remember the TikTok ban?  SurveyMonkey's team was excited. Almost immediately, they knew they needed to hop on the trend by conducting a survey on how people were feeling about TikTok. (I can relate. I remember sitting in an airport lounge writing a panic-induced blog post on the TikTok ban because HubSpot felt we should cover it, too.)  And just as Miserany's team prepared to launch their findings… TikTok released its own study. ""Guess what the media covered?"" Miserany says with a laugh. ""It was TikTok’s study."" Emily Kramer (a Masters in Marketing alum) has a phrase for this temptation to jump on every trending topic just because you can. She calls it “random acts of marketing.” And Miserany doesn't think it's going to cut it anymore.  ""To scale in this new chapter of B2B marketing, the foundation needs to be stronger. You can't do random acts of marketing. You need to set your foundation, understand your customers' needs, and then have the discipline and discernment to only build from that foundation instead of chasing shiny things,"" she tells me.  More volume without a strong foundation? That's just noise. When she was the senior director at Sheryl Sandberg's Foundation, Miserany worked on a campaign aimed at getting men to be allies to women in the workplace.  She and her team did something that most marketers would find agonizing: They spent forever in the planning phase. ""You're a small organization… So you would think the temptation would be to just start running [with something],"" Miserany tells me.  But instead, ""we spent so long beating the idea up.""  They asked themselves: What's the cost of doing this? What's the cost of not doing it?  Once they'd meticulously nailed down their vision for the campaign, execution felt ""almost effortless."" Even better, it made consistency possible.  The team created something called ""the well"" — a document that outlined exactly how they were supposed to talk about everything. If something was called ""stunning"" in the well, you couldn't call it ""gorgeous."" You stuck to the script, and you had to make a real case for deviating from it. ""The repetition of this exact language is really important for breaking through,"" Miserany explains.  ""And then you need all of your channels doing the same exact thing to have any hope of someone seeing it, recognizing it, remembering it, [and] feeling good about your brand."" The lesson for leaders: Spend time to nail the planning and trust your marketers to tell the right story every time.  Miserany gets frustrated when she sees good marketing ideas executed in a vacuum. Her solution? What she calls scaffolding.  Recently, SurveyMonkey's brand leader chatted with Miserany about the opportunity to do a sponsorship at F1.  But the idea didn't fully excite Miserany until she heard what could go along with it — like a conference, a webinar, and a follow-up email nurture campaign. ""An F1 sponsorship sounds cool, but it doesn't really get me that excited about the potential for the business until you can scaffold it with all these other things and surround it with different tactics and different storytelling, to make it helpful to our customers.” The takeaway for SMB marketers? Before launching any campaign, ask yourself: What else can we build around this? How can we turn one good idea into an integrated experience that surrounds our prospects in a way that's actually helpful? Because in a world where everyone has access to AI and can crank out content, the brands that break through won't be the ones doing more isolated tactics. They'll be the ones doing fewer things, better. Before we wrapped, Miserany told me something that surprised me: You can use SurveyMonkey to survey people you don't know. Want to test logo designs? Ask about product preferences? Validate a business idea? You can reach a targeted audience (including specific industries, locations, or demographics) without hiring an expensive research firm. “As marketers, we often talk about authenticity and alignment but those words can become buzzwords fast. How do you ensure your team stays connected to real people and not just the performance of connection?” —Bryetta Calloway, Co-founder and CEO, Stories Seen Miserany says: You absolutely must know what your customers care about and want from you. I think a lot of brands today want to be ""cool"" and that's contributing to the great flattening of brands and content across the ecosystem right now. At SurveyMonkey, we don't aspire to be cool. We want to be the lovable nerd who you want to partner with in your high school chem lab because you know we'll do all the work and make you look smart. This is how you differentiate today: know the value you provide in your customers' eyes and maximize it in everything you do. Miserany asks: Every leader must justify marketing and brand investment with hard numbers. How do you functionally bridge the gap between creative, intangible brand value and tangible financial outcomes, and how do you justify that brand investment to key stakeholders?    Exclusive interviews with industry leaders, and curated resources, to help you become a better marketer.

  I first worked across borders in the mid‑90s, interpreting Spanish calls for AT&T. What struck me then — and what still holds today — is how quickly things break down when people assume their way of working is universal. Fast‑forward nearly three decades, after leading international growth at HubSpot and advising companies from Google to SaaS startups, I’ve seen the strongest domestic strategies fall flat abroad.  Here's what I see happen over and over again: Teams think they’re being global, but they’re still defaulting to the comfort of their home market. Proximity bias and familiarity creep in quietly, and the playbook that worked so well at home suddenly stops delivering. At HubSpot, I introduced the idea of going “global-first,” a mantra we repeated often. The idea was straightforward: stop treating international as an afterthought, because the tactics that work in your home market rarely carry you into the next one. The mindset has to evolve from the start. So, where do teams go wrong with international expansion, and what should they be doing instead? Let’s break it down. Table of Contents This comprehensive kit provides everything you need to plan, execute, and measure a successful product launch. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. One of the first hurdles I see in global expansion is surprisingly simple. People don’t speak the same language about what they’re trying to do. Before teams can even talk strategy, they need a shared vocabulary. Too often, people use terms like translation, localization, and globalization interchangeably, as if they mean the same thing. They don’t, and confusing them leads to wasted money and misaligned expectations. Here’s how I break it down:  These distinctions matter because what appears to be a simple “localization problem” is often something much deeper. I've watched teams waste months trying to fix translation issues. Meanwhile, the real problem was a missing market strategy. Once everyone understands what these terms actually mean, you stop throwing money at the wrong things. Companies continue to make the same mistakes when they expand internationally. Once you understand the framework above, these become obvious. Most leaders understand product-market fit, but few think about go-to-market fit. Just because you see website traffic from another country doesn’t mean there’s a business opportunity there. I’ve seen multiple companies assume it was time to invest in India after seeing traffic spikes from the country. But when we looked closer, those visitors weren’t willing to pay U.S. prices, we didn’t accept rupees, and we had no local payment processing. Traffic didn’t equal opportunity. Without adjusting pricing and infrastructure, there was no go-to-market fit. At HubSpot, we ran into the same issue when launching our CRM in Latin America. The product resonated, but HubSpot hadn’t adjusted pricing for local economies, so only enterprise buyers could afford it. Product-market fit existed, but go-to-market fit was limited to the wealthiest segment. When HubSpot rolled out changes to our partner program, someone asked me to localize an announcement email into Japanese. It seemed simple at first, but upon reviewing the email, we noticed it included several links pointing to dependent assets, including a video, 10 blog posts, seven web pages, and more. What appeared to be a straightforward job turned out to be a localization project that would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. So, I asked the obvious question: How many partners do we have in Japan? Turns out, fewer than 10, and they were all in Tokyo. Instead of this big, elaborate campaign, we just invited them to our Tokyo office to walk them through the changes in person. It was less work for everyone and a better fit for a culture that values face-to-face relationships. I ran into a similar challenge with our website. When we were expanding to Japan, people wanted to translate our entire U.S. website. But our U.S. site was built for a market where we‘re already established. We’re a public company that people know. In Japan? Nobody had heard of us. Why would we need this complex site with all our partner integrations and advanced features when people didn't even know who we were yet? I found the playbook that works for a market leader doesn’t make sense when you’re just planting roots in a new region. Another mistake is assuming that teams have to localize every asset for every market. This mindset often leads to sprawling projects that drain time and money without making much difference to local buyers. In reality, a handful of high-value assets usually cover most customer needs. I always encourage teams to ask what’s essential at this stage in the market. Initially, it may be just a clear landing page, pricing guidance, or localized onboarding materials. You don’t need to mirror your entire U.S. website or replicate every blog post to build credibility in a new region. Translation isn’t just about words. What matters is whether the message lands with people in another culture. When HubSpot entered the Japanese market, we realized our CRM lacked a crucial feature for the region: business card scanning. In Japan, business cards are central to professional relationships, and every local CRM offers business card scanning. To succeed, we partnered with Sansan to integrate this capability into HubSpot. I still have a box of Japanese business cards from that time. I never had cards for the U.S. market, but I absolutely needed them for Japan because proper presentation matters so much there. That small but telling detail illustrates how adaptation goes beyond language. Knowing what not to do is just the beginning. The real challenge is building something that actually works.  When I joined HubSpot, one of the first things I realized was that global thinking needed to be part of daily decision-making. To make it stick, I started calling it “global-first” and brought it up constantly — in meetings, on our company wiki, and whenever I talked to executives. I invited colleagues who cared about international growth to act as ambassadors and help spread the word. We even set up a Slack channel for our “global-first” community, so people across offices could connect and share ideas. Eventually, people started using the phrase without me having to push it. New employees would hear it from their teammates and start saying it too. That's when I knew it was becoming an integral part of how we worked. What you call it doesn't really matter. What matters is making global thinking a fundamental part of how your company operates. At HubSpot, we used “global-first,” but I’ve also seen other companies adopt phrases like “global-ready” or “think global.” Even small companies can benefit by doing this early. The sooner you set global thinking as a norm, the more naturally it grows with the business. Each new market is like starting a small business inside your company. You don’t have brand recognition, customer stories, or established partners yet. Success depends on staying close to customers. That means talking with them often, listening carefully, and letting their feedback guide your next steps. Start simple, move quickly, build relationships, and grow from the ground up. If I could give only one piece of advice, it would be to hire people who bring an international perspective. They might have lived abroad, speak several languages, or grown up in a multicultural household. Equally important is curiosity about other cultures. Build this into your job descriptions and hiring practices. Make it a requirement, not just a nice-to-have. We don’t talk about international diversity nearly enough, but it has a tangible impact on growth. People with global mindsets naturally make decisions that strengthen global strategy. Local teams are closest to the customer, yet their voices often get drowned out by headquarters. You have to be intentional about amplifying them. At HubSpot, we created two programs to address this: These informal connections are crucial. When people have personal relationships across markets, they're more likely to consider global implications in their daily decisions. Don’t let aspiration cloud reality. I always advise teams to be honest about their current market position. Are people even aware you exist? Are they considering you but haven't made a purchase yet? Or are you already established and just trying to optimize your operations? Your tactics need to match that reality, not where you wish you were. You can only do so much with marketing changes. Sometimes, you actually need to change your product to fit how people work in different countries. This could involve accepting local payment methods, integrating with widely used software, or adjusting your workflows to align with local business practices. In a lot of Asian markets, who you know matters more than what your product does. You need government approval and the right introductions. Beyond that, people have to believe you‘re in it for the long haul. American companies often miss this because we’re used to more transactional relationships. Getting the right partnerships can make or break your entry into these markets. There are shortcuts to going global, especially for small businesses. Instead of building presence in each country from scratch, you can use platforms where customers already are. Launch on Amazon or Etsy for instant reach across multiple countries, or tap into partner ecosystems like the HubSpot App Marketplace. One company I advised, Lottie Dolls in Ireland, used this approach to reach customers worldwide and get distribution they would have struggled to establish on their own. The real test of an international strategy is whether it strengthens the company as a whole. Expansion shouldn’t be a side project or a box to check. It should contribute directly to goals like diversifying revenue, sharpening the product, or staying ahead of competitors. At HubSpot, international growth always connected back to company-wide targets. Too often, I see businesses chase new markets because of a traffic spike or a handful of prospect requests. That reactive approach usually wastes time and resources. The companies that get it right tie international moves to clear objectives from the start. When it’s working, you see it clearly. Local insights shape product decisions. International colleagues move into leadership roles. Perspectives from abroad guide major choices. Too many companies still think they can put off international until they‘re “ready.” But by then, you’ve already built so many assumptions and biases into your product and processes that going global becomes this massive, expensive undertaking. Start thinking globally from the beginning. It doesn‘t mean you have to launch everywhere at once. Instead, you design things knowing you’ll eventually expand beyond your home market. That makes everything else so much easier. Outline your company's marketing strategy in one simple, coherent plan. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time.

  Email subject lines determine whether your carefully crafted campaigns ever see the light of day — yet most marketers still rely on gut instinct and basic A/B testing to choose them. What if you could predict which subject lines will resonate with your audience before hitting send? AI email subject line optimization makes this possible by analyzing millions of data points from your actual subscribers’ behavior, automatically testing variations, and continuously learning what drives engagement.  But here’s what most articles won’t tell you: there’s a massive difference between using a basic AI generator to brainstorm subject lines and implementing true AI optimization. When this optimization occurs in HubSpot’s Marketing Hub with Breeze AI, you are not only testing subject lines but also creating a smart system that understands your audience and adapts to their behaviors. This guide shows you how to use AI to create subject lines that increase revenue, not just open rates. You’ll learn how to: Whether you’re sending 1,000 emails a month or 10 million, these strategies will help you turn your weakest subject lines into your strongest revenue driver, whether you send 1,000 emails a month or 10 million. Let’s dive in. Table of Contents 20 Prompts to Scale Your Marketing Without Scaling Your Team All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. AI-driven email subject line optimization is a data-driven process that utilizes machine learning to continuously test, analyze, and refine email subject lines based on actual recipient behavior and engagement patterns. Unlike simple AI generation tools that only create subject line ideas, proper optimization involves automated testing across multiple variations, real-time performance prediction, and ongoing refinement based on your specific audience’s response data. Most marketers confuse AI subject line generators with true AI optimization systems — but they’re as different as a calculator is from a financial advisor. Here’s the difference between the two: While generators simply create clever text options based on your prompts, optimization platforms like HubSpot’s Marketing Hub establish data-driven workflows that continuously test, learn, and improve subject line performance based on actual revenue results. Additionally, AI-driven email subject line optimization requires an integrated CRM system, automated testing infrastructure, and performance analytics that work together to drive measurable business outcomes — not just creative suggestions. If you’re still wondering about why AI optimization is the way to go, check out these core benefits that might sway your decision: Now, these benefits sound impressive, but you may wonder how this technology actually delivers such results in practice. Here’s a closer look at how AI email subject line optimization actually works: AI optimization amplifies your marketing expertise rather than replacing it. You maintain control over brand voice, messaging strategy, and creative direction while AI handles the heavy lifting of testing and data analysis. Think of it like this: AI is your assistant who remembers every subject line that’s ever worked for your audience and applies those insights instantly. When AI optimization happens within HubSpot’s Marketing Hub, it connects seamlessly with your contact database, behavioral triggers, and analytics dashboard. This integration means AI can: But proper optimization requires more than just powerful technology — it needs governance and measurement to ensure consistent and compliant results. Therefore, adequate optimization includes guardrails to maintain brand consistency, such as: Pro tip: Ready to move beyond basic AI generation to complete optimization? Get started with HubSpot’s Email Marketing Software and Breeze AI to elevate your subject lines from guesswork to data-driven success. Now that you understand the foundation of AI-powered subject line optimization and its critical components, let’s explore practical implementation. The following section will walk you through the exact steps to set up, configure, and deploy AI optimization in your email marketing workflow, turning these concepts into measurable results for your campaigns.  As stated above, AI-driven email subject line optimization enhances your email marketing by utilizing machine learning to test, analyze, and automatically refine subject line performance based on recipient behavior and revenue data. This process goes far beyond simple text generation — HubSpot’s Marketing Hub connects AI optimization directly to your CRM database, enabling personalized testing across segments while tracking actual conversions, not just opens. However, successful AI optimization relies on one key factor: clean, well-organized contact data. This allows the system to understand your audience’s preferences and behaviors. Before diving into the technical setup, let’s first establish the foundation that makes AI optimization possible: properly prepared email segments and data. Preparing email segments and data for AI subject line optimization involves organizing your contact database into meaningful groups based on shared characteristics and ensuring all contact information is accurate, current, and properly formatted. This preparation is crucial because AI learns from patterns in your data. It’s simple: clean, well-segmented data leads to subject lines that can increase open rates; in contrast, messy data yields generic and ineffective results that hinder engagement. The most effective AI subject lines come from four key data categories that help the AI understand recipient context and intent: Essential segmentation categories: Why do these fields matter? Well, AI uses them to predict which emotional triggers and value propositions will resonate with users. Here’s a breakdown of the essential segments you’ll need to create for optimal AI performance:  Each segment should contain at least 1,000 contacts for statistically significant AI learning. Smaller segments can be initially combined into broader categories, which can then be refined as more data is collected. AI uses these segments to identify which subject line elements — such as urgency, personalization, benefit statements, and questions — are most effective for each group. Now, clean data is, as I’m sure you’ve realized, non-negotiable for AI performance. Thus, your Smart CRM should maintain: Here’s the thing: When your data lives in a Smart CRM, AI can access the complete customer picture — not just email metrics but also sales interactions, support tickets, and website behavior. This unified view means AI can generate subject lines that reference a contact’s recent support case resolution, their upcoming renewal, or their browsing history, creating relevance that standalone email tools can’t match. Pro tip: HubSpot’s Email Marketing Software with Breeze AI automatically segments your Smart CRM data and maintains hygiene standards while generating subject lines that speak directly to each segment’s needs. Designing AI subject line prompts with brand voice guardrails involves creating structured instructions that tell AI exactly how to write in your brand’s unique style, while automatically preventing off-brand language. This systematic approach ensures that every generated subject line sounds authentically “you,” regardless of who creates it or which campaign it supports. Additionally, it converts AI-generated writing into your brand’s consistent voice, ensuring message quality remains consistent across thousands of variations. Don’t believe me? Well, here’s a complete list of reasons why you should: With these benefits in mind, the key to unlocking AI’s full potential lies in crafting the proper prompt structure from the start. A well-designed prompt template acts as your blueprint for consistent, high-performing subject lines that maintain your brand voice while exploring creative variations. That said, let’s review a proven template that top marketers use to generate subject lines that actually convert. Creating an effective prompt template is like programming your AI with your brand’s DNA — it ensures every generated subject line reflects your unique voice while exploring creative angles you might never have considered. The following template has been refined through millions of successful subject line generations across industries, providing the perfect balance of structure and flexibility. By filling in these specific components, you enhance generic AI suggestions into on-brand subject lines that consistently outperform those created manually. Pro tip: Always follow these brand do’s and don’ts: An on-brand rewrite prompt template is a structured framework that transforms generic or underperforming subject lines into compelling, brand-aligned versions while maintaining compliance and deliverability standards. So, whether you’re refining AI-generated drafts or updating legacy campaigns, this step-by-step process ensures every subject line reflects your brand personality, avoids spam triggers, and fits within optimal character limits. Here’s a universal on-brand rewrite template that’ll adapt any subject line into a high-performing, on-brand message: CRM personalization tokens are dynamic placeholders that automatically pull specific information from your customer database — like names, company details, or recent actions — into AI-generated subject lines, creating individually customized messages at scale. This combination of AI-generated content with CRM data enables you to send millions of unique subject lines that appear personally written. To help you understand the full impact of this powerful combination, here’s a brief overview of the benefits of AI and CRM token personalization: Now, understanding when to use individual tokens versus broader segment personalization is crucial for maintaining authenticity while maximizing engagement. Here’s how to choose the right personalization approach: Moreover, the depth of personalization should align with the level of your relationship with the subscriber. Here are a few examples of token use across different lifecycle stages and industries. Ready to combine AI intelligence with CRM personalization? HubSpot’s Content Hub with Breeze AI automatically pulls CRM tokens into AI-generated subject lines, creating perfectly personalized messages that drive more engagement. 20 Prompts to Scale Your Marketing Without Scaling Your Team All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Scalable personalization patterns are reusable subject line frameworks that combine AI-generated content with strategic token placement to create thousands of unique, relevant messages without requiring manual customization for each recipient. These patterns serve as templates, allowing AI to fill in the creative elements. At the same time, CRM tokens provide individual context, enabling you to maintain personal relevance across millions of emails while reducing production time. To help you get started, check out this list of token patterns for welcome, upgrade, renewal, and re‑engagement: Pro tip: Start by creating 3 to 4 patterns per campaign type and test them across small segments before deploying them fully. Document which token combinations work best for each customer segment and lifecycle stage, then use Breeze AI to automatically apply personalization patterns across your entire database. Now that you’ve mastered scalable personalization patterns, it's time to let data determine which variations drive the best results. This can be done one way and one way only: with A/B testing. AI-powered A/B testing for subject lines is a systematic process that automatically generates multiple variations, simultaneously tests them across audience segments, and uses machine learning to identify winning patterns that can be applied to future campaigns. Here’s how you implement A/B testing for your AI-optimized subject lines: Start with a clear hypothesis: Every successful test starts with a clear hypothesis about what will improve performance. Your hypothesis should be specific and measurable, such as “Adding urgency tokens will increase open rates by 20% for cart abandonment emails” rather than vague goals like “improve engagement.” Define your testing variables: Select 4-5 specific elements to test systematically: Tone Variables: Professional vs. conversational, formal vs. casual, urgent vs. relaxed, emotional vs. logical Benefit Variables: Feature-focused vs. outcome-focused, individual vs. team benefits, immediate vs. long-term value Structure Variables: Question vs. statement, number-led vs. text-only, single vs. multiple benefits, short vs. detailed Personalization Variables: No tokens vs. first name vs. company name vs. behavioral tokens, single vs. multiple tokens AI transforms your testing variables into intelligent variations rather than random combinations. Additionally, it analyzes your historical campaign data to understand which elements typically resonate with your audience, then generates variations that explore promising new combinations while avoiding patterns that have previously failed. However, proper optimization comes from understanding why specific variants won, not just which ones performed best. Here’s how you can analyze results and apply learnings systematically: Pro tip: When setting up email A/B testing in Marketing Hub, use the automated winner selection feature to deploy your best performer without manual intervention Creating a comprehensive variant matrix ensures you’re testing multiple dimensions simultaneously while maintaining brand consistency across all variations. This structured framework generates 16 to 20 testable variants from just 4 to 5 core variables, maximizing learning from each test cycle. Use this planning matrix to guide your variant test design for your next email marketing campaign: Segment Tone Variant Structure Variant Personalization Level Benefit Focus Example Output New Leads Welcoming Question None Educational “Ready to master email marketing basics?” New Leads Professional Statement First name Educational “[firstname], your email marketing guide is here” New Leads Casual Number-led None Outcome “5 ways to triple your email opens today” New Leads Urgent Statement Company Quick win “[company] can boost engagement 40% now” Active Users Conversational Question Product mention Feature “Want to unlock [product]’s hidden features?” Active Users Professional Statement First name + product ROI “[firstname], [product] saved users $2M this year"" Active Users Excited Number-led Behavioral Time-saving “You’re 3 clicks from saving 5 hours weekly” Active Users Direct Statement Company Competitive “[company] outperforms competitors by 47%” At-Risk Empathetic Question First name + timeframe Re-engagement “[firstname], what’s changed since [last_login]?” At-Risk Urgent Statement Product Loss aversion “Your [product] benefits expire in 48 hours” At-Risk Casual Number-led None New features “17 new features added since you left” At-Risk Professional Question Company Value reminder “Is [company] still interested in 3X growth?” VIP/Enterprise Executive Statement Company + metrics Strategic “[company]: Q4 performance report ready” VIP/Enterprise Consultative Question Full personalization Partnership “[firstname], ready to discuss [company]’s 2025 roadmap?” VIP/Enterprise Data-driven Number-led Industry benchmark Competitive insight “[industry] leaders increased revenue 62% using this” VIP/Enterprise Exclusive Statement Custom token Premium access “[account_type] exclusive: Early access approved” Lastly, here are a few best practices to maximize your variant testing effectiveness: With your variant matrix established and initial tests deployed, the real optimization power comes from systematically applying what you learn. Next, let’s walk through how to create an iteration loop that continuously improves your subject line performance. An iteration loop in AI subject line optimization is a continuous improvement cycle where AI analyzes test results, identifies winning patterns, and automatically generates new hypotheses for the next round of testing. This self-improving system upgrades one-time tests into compounding knowledge that gets smarter with every campaign. AI goes beyond simple winner/loser identification to uncover the underlying patterns that drive performance. It analyzes multiple dimensions simultaneously — examining how tone, length, personalization, and timing interact to influence open rates across different segments. To build your iteration cadence, establish a weekly rhythm that maintains momentum without overwhelming your team or audience. Here’s an outline you can follow: For instance, AI might discover that urgent language increases opens by 32% for cart abandonment emails but decreases them by 18% for educational content, or that first-name personalization works for B2C but reduces trust in B2B communications. Then, it creates pattern reports that highlight unexpected correlations: “Question-based subject lines perform 41% better when combined with numbers” or “Emojis increase opens for users under 35 but only when placed at the beginning of the subject line.” These insights would typically require weeks of manual analysis to uncover, but thanks to AI’s data-driven capabilities, they are automatically surfaced within 48 hours of test completion. Now that your iteration loop is continuously improving subject line performance, it’s crucial to measure the real business impact of these optimizations beyond just open rates. Let’s examine how to track and attribute revenue gains directly to your AI-powered subject lines. Measuring the impact of AI-generated subject lines requires tracking performance metrics across multiple touchpoints, from initial opens to final conversions, to understand the actual business value beyond vanity metrics. Start with open rate as your baseline quality signal, but understand it's just the first step in measuring impact. A reasonable open rate (25-35% for most industries) indicates your subject line resonated, but quality indicators within opens reveal deeper insights: These quality signals reveal whether your AI-generated subject lines attract engaged readers or just curious clickers. Then, move beyond open to measure clicks to priority links — the specific CTAs that drive business value. Track not just the overall click rate, but also clicks to your primary conversion points, such as: Pro tip: If opens increase but priority clicks decrease, your subject lines might be misleading readers. 20 Prompts to Scale Your Marketing Without Scaling Your Team All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. To track and optimize your AI subject line performance, create custom dashboards that visualize subject line performance across segments and time periods for actionable insights. Your primary dashboard should display: Set up automated weekly reports that highlight winning patterns and flag underperforming segments needing attention. Then, build a secondary dashboard for testing insights that tracks: This testing dashboard becomes your optimization roadmap, showing exactly where to focus future efforts. Building a comprehensive library of winning subject line patterns transforms scattered test results into a strategic asset that compounds in value over time. Think of it as your team’s playbook — a centralized repository where every successful formula, proven pattern, and performance insight lives, ready to be deployed across future campaigns. This documentation will ensure that the lessons learned from thousands of sends don’t disappear when team members change roles or campaigns evolve, but instead become institutional knowledge that drives consistent improvement. Here’s how to build and maintain your winning plays library effectively: For each winning play, document the complete formula, such as “For cart abandonment emails to engaged users, combining first name + specific product + time limit achieves X% open rates.” Then, do the following: Safeguarding deliverability during AI subject line optimization involves implementing automated checks and manual reviews to ensure that every generated subject line meets legal requirements, avoids spam triggers, and maintains a sender’s reputation while still achieving performance goals. This protective schema prevents the deliverability drop that occurs when aggressive optimization ignores compliance rules, maintaining inbox placement rates above 95% while still achieving 30 to 40% open rate improvements through AI optimization. If you’re serious about maintaining high deliverability while optimizing aggressively, here’s an essential compliance checklist for AI-generated subject lines: Another significant aspect of email marketing is following CAN-SPAM best practices. The CAN-SPAM Act mandates specific requirements that any email subject line must follow, with violations carrying penalties up to $53,088 per email: Configure your AI to flag potentially non-compliant subject lines for legal review, especially those mentioning health claims, financial promises, or competitive comparisons. Lastly, here are a few general tips that I’ll leave you with to protect your sender reputation while scaling AI optimization: Now that you understand how to optimize safely within compliance boundaries, let’s explore the specific steps to implement these strategies directly within HubSpot’s CRM, where automation and safeguards work in tandem seamlessly. Optimizing AI subject lines in HubSpot combines Breeze AI’s generation capabilities with Marketing Hub’s testing infrastructure to create, personalize, and automatically deploy winning subject lines based on real performance data. Begin by navigating to Marketing > Email in your HubSpot portal and create or select your email campaign.       Click the subject line field to write a subject line.

The following streamlined approach combines HubSpot’s segmentation tools with Breeze’s AI-generation capabilities to produce tested, personalized subject lines:  Emojis can increase open rates when used strategically. Test emojis with younger demographics and B2C audiences first, ensuring they display correctly across all email clients and devices. Pro tip: Place emojis at the beginning or end of subject lines for maximum visibility. Avoid them in professional services, healthcare, or financial communications where they may reduce credibility. Always A/B test emoji versus non-emoji versions for your specific audience. Here’s what you should know about optimizing subject line length for maximum impact: Check out these recommendations for balancing personalization with subscriber privacy and trust: Use the following lifecycle stage segmentation to adapt your AI-generated subject lines to each customer’s journey stage: Lifecycle stage mapping: Adjust urgency, personalization depth, and offer types based on the psychology of each stage. Pro tip: Within HubSpot’s Email Marketing Software, you can create customizable lifecycle stages based on your customer base. Create a central prompt library in your content management system with: Additionally, implement approval workflows for AI-generated content before deployment, and use HubSpot’s Content Hub to set guardrails that automatically flag off-brand language. Then, schedule quarterly reviews to refine prompts based on performance data and ensure consistency as your brand evolves. AI-powered subject line optimization represents a fundamental shift in how we approach email marketing.

  Generative AI tools like ChatGPT have changed individual work, but using them in a company causes many challenges. Teams copy-paste customer data into external interfaces, but the outputs lack context from your CRM, and there's no audit trail when something goes wrong. Security teams raise red flags, compliance officers demand answers, and leadership questions whether the technology is ready for production use.  The gap between consumer AI and enterprise AI isn‘t just about features. It’s about integration, governance, data sovereignty, and the ability to prove measurable business outcomes. Enterprise generative AI tools help by integrating AI into your workflows and systems, allowing safe large-scale AI deployment. This guide provides production-proven use cases, a vendor evaluation matrix, a practical rollout plan, and a governance checklist. We‘ll even show how platforms like HubSpot’s Breeze AI integrate these capabilities into marketing, sales, and service workflows. Table of Contents Ideate, create, and share content. Easily create... Enterprise generative AI tools deliver measurable value when applied to specific, repeatable workflows. Here's how leading organizations deploy these tools across marketing, sales, and customer service. Marketing teams use generative AI to create blog posts, social media content, email campaigns, and landing page copy that fits the brand voice and targets different audience segments. The difference between consumer and enterprise tools shows up in brand consistency controls, approval workflows, and the ability to ground content in your actual customer data. What I like: Tools that connect to your CRM can use real customer interactions, sales call pain points, and product usage patterns to create relevant content. Rather than creating one-size-fits-all campaigns, generative AI analyzes customer behavior, engagement history, and firmographic data to generate personalized messaging, subject lines, and calls-to-action for each recipient. This moves beyond simple merge tags to genuinely adaptive content. Enterprise AI tools analyze search intent, identify content gaps, and generate SEO-optimized content that addresses specific queries your target accounts are asking. They can also optimize existing content for better search visibility and suggest internal linking strategies. Pro tip: AI workflow automation is more effective when generative AI tools can trigger actions based on content performance and adjust campaigns according to engagement data. Instead of manually pulling data from multiple platforms, generative AI synthesizes campaign performance across channels, identifies patterns, and generates executive summaries with actionable recommendations. This goes beyond basic merge tags to truly adaptive content. Sales teams use AI to craft personalized outreach sequences that reference specific pain points, recent company news, and mutual connections. Enterprise tools ground these emails in CRM data, ensuring accuracy and relevance rather than generic templates. Best for: Teams that need to personalize outreach at scale without sacrificing the quality that comes from manual research. Before every call, generative AI compiles account history, recent interactions, open opportunities, and relevant market intelligence into a concise briefing. This eliminates prep work and ensures reps enter conversations fully informed. Writing proposals typically requires pulling information from multiple sources, past proposals, product documentation, and case studies. Generative AI assembles customized proposals by analyzing RFP requirements and matching them to your capabilities, significantly reducing turnaround time. What we like: Tools that maintain a knowledge base of past successful proposals and can identify winning patterns in your responses. Enterprise AI tools transcribe sales calls, identify key moments, extract action items, and update CRM records automatically. They also analyze conversation patterns to identify what top performers do differently and surface coaching opportunities. Pro tip: Generative AI in sales works best when integrated directly into the tools reps already use, eliminating context switching and increasing adoption. By analyzing pipeline data, win/loss patterns, and deal progression, generative AI provides early warning signals about at-risk deals and suggests specific actions to move opportunities forward. Rather than manually creating and maintaining help articles, generative AI analyzes support tickets, identifies common questions, and generates comprehensive knowledge base content. It also keeps articles current by suggesting updates based on recent ticket trends. AI analyzes incoming support requests, extracts key information, determines urgency, and routes tickets to the appropriate team or agent. This reduces response times and ensures customers reach the right expert faster. Service agents receive AI-generated response drafts based on ticket content, customer history, and knowledge base articles. Agents can accept, edit, or regenerate suggestions, dramatically reducing handle time while maintaining quality. What we like: Systems that learn from agent edits to improve future suggestions, creating a continuous improvement loop. Generative AI monitors customer interactions across channels, identifies frustration or churn risk, and automatically escalates critical issues to senior support staff or account managers before small problems become major incidents. Modern AI-powered chatbots move beyond rigid decision trees to understand natural language, access your knowledge base and CRM, and resolve common issues without human intervention. They escalate to human agents when needed, passing along full context. Pro tip: The most effective implementations of generative AI and customer centricity use unified customer data to ensure AI responses are informed by purchase history, support history, and account status. Instead of reading hundreds of survey responses, chat transcripts, and reviews manually, generative AI identifies themes, sentiment trends, and actionable insights that inform product and service improvements. Selecting the right enterprise generative AI platform requires evaluating capabilities beyond impressive demos. Here's what actually matters in production environments.  Enterprise generative AI tools automate and enhance marketing, sales, and customer service workflows most effectively when they connect natively to your core systems. Surface-level integrations via API create maintenance overhead and data sync issues. Look for tools that embed directly into your CRM, marketing automation platform, and customer service software. Why this matters: When AI tools access unified customer data in real-time, they generate more accurate outputs, eliminate manual data transfer, and reduce security risks. A CRM-first approach means every AI interaction is grounded in actual customer context, not generic training data. Best enterprise generative AI tools integrate with CRM and core business systems while maintaining strict data controls. Evaluate how tools handle: Data residency and sovereignty: Where is your data processed and stored? Can you specify geographic constraints to meet regulatory requirements? Access controls and permissions: Does the tool respect your existing role-based access controls, or does it create a new permission system that requires separate management? Audit trails and observability: Can you track what data was accessed, what prompts were used, and what outputs were generated? This becomes critical for compliance and troubleshooting. Data retention and deletion: How long are prompts and outputs stored? Can you enforce retention policies consistent with your existing data governance framework? Pro tip: Governance controls mitigate risk and ensure accuracy in generative AI outputs by creating layers of verification before information reaches customers or makes decisions. Every enterprise has unique workflows, terminology, and business logic. The right platform allows you to: Understanding when to use different types of AI assistance matters. Breeze Copilot assists with in-flow AI guidance and automation across teams by providing suggestions and drafts that humans review. Autonomous agents handle end-to-end processes with minimal supervision, like automatically responding to common support tickets or enriching lead data. The best platforms support both copilot and agent modes, letting you match the level of automation to task complexity and risk tolerance. They also provide orchestration capabilities that let multiple specialized agents work together on complex workflows. Production AI systems require monitoring beyond traditional software metrics. Look for platforms that provide: This observability enables continuous improvement and helps you identify where AI adds value versus where it creates friction. Enterprise generative AI pricing models vary dramatically across vendors. Common structures include: Per-user pricing: Fixed cost per seat, regardless of usage intensity. Predictable but potentially expensive if only some users leverage AI heavily. Usage-based pricing: Charges based on API calls, tokens processed, or outputs generated. Scales with actual consumption but requires monitoring to prevent runaway costs. Hybrid models: Combines base platform fees with usage-based components, balancing predictability and flexibility. What to watch for: Hidden costs for training, customization, premium models, or data storage. Ask vendors for representative customer consumption patterns to inform your forecasts.

Successful integration requires a methodical approach that balances speed with stability. Here's how to deploy enterprise generative AI tools without disrupting existing workflows. Before integrating any AI platform, map where your customer data lives, how it flows between systems, and what quality issues exist. Identify your systems of record for customer information, understand data duplication and inconsistency issues, document integration points and data flows, and assess data quality and completeness in each system. What if your data is fragmented across different tools? Start with a CRM-first data alignment approach rather than attempting to integrate everything at once. Focus on ensuring your CRM contains authoritative customer records, then connect AI tools to that single source of truth. This pragmatic path delivers incremental wins while avoiding the delays of large-scale data consolidation projects. Choose between native integrations provided by your AI platform, custom API integrations for proprietary systems or unique requirements, middleware solutions for connecting disparate systems, and embedded AI where the platform itself includes AI capabilities (like Breeze within HubSpot). Native integrations typically offer the deepest functionality with the least maintenance overhead. Embedded AI eliminates integration entirely by building AI into the platforms you already use, which is why platforms like HubSpot that combine CRM, marketing, sales, and service capabilities with native AI deliver faster time to value. Set clear policies for what data AI systems can access, how outputs should be reviewed before reaching customers, and who can use different AI capabilities. Implement technical controls including role-based access that mirrors existing CRM permissions, data masking for sensitive fields like payment information, audit logging for all AI interactions, and retention policies for prompts and outputs. These governance controls should be in place before rolling out AI to production users, not added afterward. Rather than attempting organization-wide deployment, begin with a single high-value use case and a small team. Choose a workflow where AI can deliver measurable improvement, success metrics are clear, and the team is eager to adopt new tools. Run the pilot for 30-60 days, gathering quantitative metrics on efficiency gains, quality improvements, and user satisfaction alongside qualitative feedback about what works and what creates friction. As you expand from pilot to broader deployment, establish reusable patterns for common integration needs. Document how to connect AI tools to different data sources, create standardized prompt templates for recurring tasks, build feedback loops that improve AI performance over time, and establish monitoring dashboards that track AI usage and outcomes. These patterns accelerate subsequent rollouts and ensure consistency across teams. The quality of AI outputs depends heavily on input quality. Provide training on crafting effective prompts, understanding when to provide more context versus letting AI infer, recognizing and flagging AI hallucinations or errors, and editing AI outputs rather than accepting them wholesale. Teams that understand how to work effectively with AI extract far more value than those who view it as a black box that either works or doesn't. AI platforms improve with use, but only if you create feedback mechanisms that capture learning. Implement regular reviews of AI output quality, analysis of which suggestions users accept versus reject, A/B testing of different prompt strategies, and model fine-tuning based on your specific use cases. The most successful enterprises treat AI integration as an ongoing optimization process rather than a one-time implementation project. The solution involves layered controls rather than a single mechanism. Trusted source grounding: Configure AI tools to prioritize your knowledge base, CRM data, and verified documentation. When AI pulls from authoritative sources you control, hallucination risk drops significantly. Prompt standards: Establish templates for common tasks that instruct AI to admit uncertainty, request clarification when needed, and cite sources for factual claims. Graduated review levels: Match review requirements to risk. Internal summaries need no review, customer-facing content gets agent review, and high-risk communications require specialist approval. Agent guardrails: Implement rules that prevent autonomous agents from taking actions above certain risk thresholds without human approval, such as spending limits or customer communication boundaries. Continuous evaluation: Regularly sample AI outputs and track accuracy over time. This identifies where additional controls are needed without slowing every workflow. The key insight: different workflows tolerate different error rates. Design governance to match actual risk rather than applying uniform restrictions everywhere. Enterprise generative AI pricing models create budgeting challenges because consumption patterns are unpredictable initially. Understand your pricing model: Clarify whether you're paying per user, per usage (API calls, tokens, outputs), or hybrid. Ask vendors for representative consumption patterns from similar customers. Start with a pilot budget: Allocate budget for a 60-90 day pilot with defined scope. Measure actual consumption, extrapolate based on planned rollout, and build in a buffer for higher adoption. Implement monitoring: Set up dashboards tracking consumption against budget in real-time with alerts when usage exceeds thresholds. This prevents surprise costs and identifies optimization opportunities. Forecast with governance: Your governance controls directly impact costs. Systems requiring human review will consume less than autonomous agents operating continuously. Consider opportunity cost: Compare AI costs against the labor cost of performing tasks manually. If AI reduces a two-hour process to fifteen minutes, the productivity gain typically far exceeds usage costs. Most enterprises find that AI costs represent a small fraction of efficiency gains, but the shift to consumption-based pricing requires different budgeting processes. Use copilots when: Use autonomous agents when: Examples in practice: Copilot: Drafting sales emails where reps review and personalize before sending. AI provides structure, humans control tone and timing. Agent: Automatically enriching leads with firmographic data. The process is mechanical, errors are non-critical, and review would create bottlenecks. Copilot: Generating knowledge base articles where experts review for accuracy before publishing. Agent: Routing support tickets based on content analysis, with confidence scores triggering human review for ambiguous cases. Many enterprises start with copilots to build trust, then gradually shift appropriate workflows to autonomous agents as confidence grows. Enterprise generative AI rollouts follow predictable phases, though timelines vary based on complexity and governance needs. Phase 1: Assessment and Planning (4-8 weeks) Define success metrics, audit data architecture, establish governance framework, select platform, and identify pilot teams. Gating criteria: Clear use case with metrics, executive alignment, governance documented. Phase 2: Pilot Implementation (6-12 weeks) Configure integrations, set up access controls, train pilot team, launch with monitoring, and gather feedback. Gating criteria: Measurable value demonstrated, user satisfaction above threshold, no critical security issues. Phase 3: Iterative Expansion (3-6 months) Roll out in waves, refine workflows based on learnings, expand integrations, and build training programs. Gating criteria: Previous wave shows sustained value, training scaled, support team ready. Phase 4: Organization-Wide Deployment (6-12 months from start) Deploy to all teams, establish AI governance centers of excellence, and measure business impact. What extends timelines: Data issues: Fragmented customer data or poor quality adds 8-16 weeks if not addressed upfront. Governance complexity: Heavily regulated industries require extensive controls, adding 4-8 weeks. Integration challenges: Legacy systems or complex customizations can add months. Change management: Resistance or inadequate training slows adoption significantly. Organizations that treat deployment as change management rather than purely technology see faster adoption, even if initial rollout takes longer. Data fragmentation is the norm for enterprises. Customer information lives in CRM, marketing automation, support platforms, billing systems, and departmental spreadsheets. This doesn't prevent AI adoption—it just requires a pragmatic approach. Start with your CRM as the hub: Focus on ensuring your CRM contains authoritative customer records. Connect AI tools to that single source of truth first. This delivers immediate value while avoiding multi-year consolidation projects. HubSpot Smart CRM serves as a unified data layer for enterprise AI tools by connecting marketing, sales, and service data in one platform. When Breeze AI accesses this unified view, outputs are grounded in complete customer context. Pursue incremental integration: After establishing your CRM hub, add integrations progressively based on value. Connect your support platform second to ensure AI sees customer issues. Add product usage analytics third to inform outreach. Each integration delivers incremental value. Accept some manual input: For hard-to-integrate data sources, consider whether occasional manual input is acceptable. Five minutes of prep for important calls with manual context may be more pragmatic than complex integrations. Leverage AI for data quality: AI can identify missing information in customer records, suggest corrections to inconsistent data, and enrich records by extracting information from emails and call notes. This creates a virtuous cycle where AI improves the data that makes it more effective. Plan your long-term architecture: Map data sources, identify redundancy, define authoritative systems for each data type, and create a phased alignment plan. AI adoption accelerates when your data strategy supports it. The key insight: waiting for perfect data creates opportunity cost. Start with the data you have, deliver value quickly, and use early wins to justify comprehensive data alignment. The gap between experimenting with AI and deploying it successfully across your enterprise comes down to integration, governance, and a clear implementation plan. The tools exist, the use cases are proven, and organizations that move deliberately but decisively are building sustainable advantages. Whether you're just beginning to explore enterprise generative AI or ready to scale beyond pilot projects, the framework in this guide provides a practical path forward. Focus on unified customer data, establish governance that balances control with velocity, and match your deployment approach to organizational readiness. Ideate, create, and share content.

  In the first episode of my Nudge podcast, I interviewed the fantastic psychologist Dr. Adrian North, who conducted one of the seminal studies on the psychology of music.  Back in 1997, the researchers stocked an English supermarket with four types of French and German wines, all similarly matched in cost, dryness, and sweetness. For two weeks, the store speakers either played German oom-pah music or French accordion music. North and his colleagues would switch the music daily and measure the effect on sales. Turns out, 83% of wine buyers bought French wine when the accordion music was playing, while 65% of buyers picked German bottles when the Bavarian music was on. North interviewed these buyers as they left the store, but no one claimed the music had an effect on their purchase — yet it clearly did.  North’s study had some important results, but it’s worth noting that this study is almost three decades old and has a relatively small sample size of just 82 people. So, are the findings still relevant today? Well, in 2017, researchers at Montclair State University found that playing Italian music in a university cafeteria increased sales of their Italian dish (chicken parmesan). When playing Spanish flamenco tunes, they increased sales of paella. It’s clear that music does seem to shape what we buy. And maybe even what we want to eat? Indeed, during a recent trip to Paris, I couldn’t help but stop at the local boulangerie each morning for a coffee and croissant. Thinking back, I realized that they routinely played French café-style music. Perhaps that’s what drew me in. In his book Pre-Suasion, Robert B. Cialdini writes that music made children 3x more likely to help their peers. Similarly, in Get It Done, Ayelet Fishbach shared how music can increase gym reps by 50%. And Nick Kolenda’s work in Imagine Reading This Book shows that sad music makes exciting life landmarks feel further away. Yet, the study on music that’s arguably most influential involves (more) supermarket shoppers. In Ronald E. Milliman’s study (aptly titled “Using Background Music to Affect the Behavior of Supermarket Shoppers”), he monitored the flow of shoppers as they navigated a supermarket in the southern U.S. Over nine weeks, he found that customers spent 38% more when slow music (60 BPM) was played compared to fast music (108 BPM).  Milliman and his team concluded that the pace of the music influenced the speed of the shoppers. In other words, a slow tempo slowed down the pace of shopping, giving the customers more time to buy. Compelling, right? In his wonderful book Sensehacking, Charles Spence desperately tried to find companies that have applied this insight into music and tempo (and were willing to talk about it). One of the few public examples is Chipotle. According to Spence, Chipotle carefully controls the tempo of the music in all of its 3,500+ stores. They deliberately play faster music at busy times of the day to speed up their customers and shorten the long lines. Chipotle’s in-house DJ is quoted as saying, “The lunch and dinner rush have songs with higher BPMs because we need to keep the customers moving.” During the quieter periods, the store plays slower tunes to keep customers lingering and keep the store busy. So, the next time you find yourself chomping down on your lunchtime burrito or reaching for that bottle of German wine, take a minute and ask yourself: “What music is playing right now?” Access the guide to learn more about psychology.

  A few months back, I was having a bit of a professional identity crisis — and it was all thanks to answer engine optimization (AEO) best practices.   Before 2024, I spent the better part of a decade focused on topping search engine result pages, and, frankly, I was great at it. I knew the ins and outs of keywords, schema, and even technical SEO aspects like site speed. But with the rise of AI, those skills were slowly becoming less urgent, for lack of a better word. (Cue marketer existential panic.) Search and consumer behavior have changed dramatically. While traditional search engines still dominate, people increasingly turn to AI tools like ChatGPT to answer their questions. Heck, with 79% of those who already use AI for search believing it offers a better experience than traditional search engines, even Google has introduced AI overviews to stay competitive. This shift demands a new approach and skills for digital marketers like me. Unfortunately, AEO is generally a mystery to businesses and marketers alike, but at HubSpot, we're slowly putting together the pieces.  We’ve been researching and experimenting with how we produce and format content for AI and loop marketing for almost a year. In this article, I’ll share some of the most critical AEO best practices we’ve uncovered. Table of Contents Navigate the AI revolution with proven strategies to optimize your content for AI-powered discovery. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Answer engine optimization (AEO) is the process of making your content easy for AI-powered systems — like Google AI Overviews and ChatGPT — to find, understand, and cite. Unlike traditional SEO, AEO focuses on direct answers, structured data, and authority signals that help your brand appear in zero-click results and AI summaries. To get started, map user questions, structure content for quick answers, add the right schema markup for AEO, and track your visibility with tools like HubSpot's AI Search Grader. Ready to see where you stand? Check it for free. At its core, answer engine optimization is the strategic practice of structuring your content so AI-powered systems can easily extract, understand, and present it as authoritative answers. Many in the industry also refer to related terms like generative engine optimization (GEO) or large language model optimization (LLMO), but “AEO” emphasizes the answer. When someone asks ChatGPT for marketing advice, queries Google for a quick definition, or speaks to Alexa about local services, AEO determines whether your brand is cited in the response. Feature Traditional SEO Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) Goal Rank high in SERPs, drive website traffic Get cited in AI responses, win zero-click visibility Content focus Broad, long–form, targeting keyword groups Precise, Q&A–style, direct answers (brief + extended) Signals Backlinks, keyword metrics, domain authority, Mentions, semantic markup, freshness, structured data Metrics Impressions, clicks, CTR, conversions, visits Citation rate, share of AI voice, AI impressions, brand mentions Time horizon Medium to long term, with sustained growth Some faster wins (snippets), but needs continual adaptation When people use a search engine, they get back what the tool thinks are the best resources to answer their question. Like if I searched the very scientific question of “what are the best action movies of all time?”, it would give me a bunch of different resources (websites, videos, even forum responses), which it believes could offer the information I’m looking for.  That’s why the goal of traditional SEO is to increase rankings, clicks, and, in turn, website traffic. As marketers, that means targeting keywords, building backlinks, securing a place on page one, if not position one, and tracking impressions, click-through rates, and organic sessions. (All that good stuff I used to tackle.) Read: 8 SEO Challenges Brands Face [HubSpot Blog Data] Answer engines don’t just give users possible resources; they attempt to provide the exact answer they want. For example, if I ask ChatGPT for the best action movies of all time, it’ll give me a list compiled from many sources rather than simply linking to some pages for me to check out.  Because of that, the goal of AEO is citations and inclusion in those answers. As marketers, you need to structure your content for extraction, use schema markup to clarify meaning, and build authority so language models trust and reference your expertise. And you’ll track success with the number of zero-click answers, AI summaries, and voice responses, even when users never visit your website.  The strategic difference is visibility without traffic. A well-optimized answer might get cited thousands of times in ChatGPT conversations or Google AI Overviews without generating a single session in your analytics. This challenges traditional attribution models but extends your brand's reach into entirely new contexts where buying decisions increasingly begin. In short: SEO gets traffic. AEO owns the answer. Read: The essential SEO tutorial for thriving in the age of AI-driven search The internet is shifting from a click-based economy to an answer-based one, and your brand can easily get overlooked if you ignore AEO. Don’t believe me? Google reports that nearly 60% of searches now end without a click as users get what they need directly from AI Overviews, featured snippets, or knowledge panels. On top of that, generative AI is appearing on most major tech platforms (i.e., Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, and Gemini), and voice assistants answer queries in seconds, often citing a single source. ChatGPT alone nearly doubled its weekly average users to 800 million from February to August this year, so clearly, this trend is not slowing down. Brand visibility now depends on being cited and summarized by these systems, not just ranking well in search. But note: That does not mean you can neglect SEO. AI engine optimization actually complements SEO and inbound marketing; it doesn't replace them. AEO draws on many SEO foundations — strong content, domain credibility, internal linking — but reorients priorities so that content is machine-friendly, structured, and ready to be quoted or excerpted. While traditional SEO remains essential for driving traffic, AEO determines whether your brand appears in the most important answers. So, think of it as a new layer to your existing content strategy, not a separate thing competing for resources. Navigate the AI revolution with proven strategies to optimize your content for AI-powered discovery. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Effective AEO means work across your content production process. Each practice below includes specific workflows, clear ownership, and actionable checklists to help your team execute with confidence. AEO is extremely question and answer-focused. So, start by building a question inventory that captures what your audience typically asks at every stage of their journey. Connect with sales and customer service to understand the questions prospects and customers frequently ask. Then, mine Google‘s “People Also Ask” (PAA) boxes for your core topics. These reveal what users want answered and what Google’s algorithm considers relevant. Once collected, audit your existing content to identify gaps or opportunities to update content to answer these questions. Also, research them in both search engines and AI tools to see how your competitors are currently performing for them. From there, segment questions by funnel stage and buyer persona. Here are some general guidelines you can follow: Pro tip: Track this inventory in a shared spreadsheet or your CRM, noting which questions you've covered, which are in progress, and which represent content gaps your competitors might be filling first. When you search Google, its AI doesn't read your entire article linearly. Instead, it identifies answer-like structures (short paragraphs after questions, numbered steps, comparison tables) and decides if that content directly addresses a user’s query. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT do something similar during training and retrieval, prioritizing content that presents information in clear, modular blocks that they can confidently cite. To optimize for this behavior, lead every key section with a 40-60-word direct answer that fully addresses the question, similar to how you would typically go after “featured snippets” in Google (more on that later). If someone asks, “What is inbound marketing?” define it in two or three sentences in your first paragraph — no fluff, preamble, or quips (as much as this one pains me), just the answer. Follow that with supporting detail, examples, and context for readers wanting depth. Also, use scannable formatting like bullet points, numbered lists, and tables, and keep paragraphs under four sentences when possible. This isn‘t about dumbing down your content; it’s about making valuable information accessible to both busy readers and skimming algorithms. If you have the resources, adopt reusable content block patterns that answer engines recognize. Think definition blocks for terminology, step-by-step blocks for processes, pros-and-cons blocks for evaluations, and example blocks for illustration. Here’s an example of a definition box from one of my HubSpot articles on organic marketing:  Source These patterns act as semantic signals that help AI identify what type of information you're providing and how to extract it accurately. Pro tip: Content Hub can help you templatize these patterns, streamline content briefs, and maintain editorial governance at scale as your team produces more AEO-optimized content. So can schema. Schema markup is structured data you add to your HTML to explicitly tell search engines and AI systems what your content represents. It's the difference between Google guessing that your page is a how-to guide and Google knowing with certainty that it is, with five specific steps, an estimated completion time, and required tools. Focus on these core schema types for AEO impact: CMS SEO tools in platforms like HubSpot let you templatize schema across content types so your team doesn't hand-code for every post. If you’re a HubSpot user, set up templates for your most common content types— blog posts, guides, FAQs, and product pages — and the schema will be applied automatically with clean, crawlable HTML. Featured snippets and “People Also Ask” boxes are Google‘s most visible answer formats, and they serve as training data for how AI Overviews select and present information.  When your content appears in a featured snippet, you've essentially been pre-selected by Google as the authoritative answer, which definitely increases your chances of being cited by AI summaries and language models that crawl the web. To win featured snippets, keep these guidelines in mind when creating content: Pro tip: To systematically capture more features,  harvest “People Also Ask” questions for your target topics every quarter. Open an incognito browser, search your core keywords, and document every PAA question that appears. Note which ones you already answer well, which you answer poorly, and which you don't address at all. Prioritize updating existing high-authority pages to target new PAA questions rather than creating new content. Google favors established pages for featured snippets, so enhancing what already ranks often delivers faster results. Navigate the AI revolution with proven strategies to optimize your content for AI-powered discovery. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Recent research shows that content including citations, quotes, and statistics is 30-40% more visible in AI search results. This emphasizes the importance of backing up claims with credible sources and maintaining high editorial standards. That said, strengthen your content by: Social proof works. I mean, it’s marketing 101. The more people rave about something or buy it, the more others are likely to believe it’s true. AI and LLMs work similarly. They learn what to trust based on which sources appear frequently across authoritative contexts. In other words, LLMs are more likely to treat your content as credible and worth citing if your brand is cited in reputable industry publications, discussed in high-quality forums, and referenced in academic or government sources. Off-site authority isn't just about backlinks for SEO, however. It’s about establishing proof that your brand is a legitimate subject-matter expert across many different online territories. Think other publications, forums, review sites, and social media platforms. Knowing this, you want to develop a multichannel distribution strategy that prioritizes platforms where your audience and AI training data intersect. This could mean: Multi-channel diversification is built into the Loop Marketing playbook in the Amplify stage. Learn more about it here. Pro tip: Content Remix can help you with this repurposing in one click.  Plus, Marketing Hub automation can help orchestrate this distribution at scale, scheduling cross-platform posts, tracking engagement, and measuring which channels drive the most authority signals and referral traffic back to your owned content. Voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant choose answers differently from visual search results and LLMs. They need concise, factually unambiguous, and structured content that can be spoken aloud in 15-30 seconds and is formatted for natural language comprehension. When someone asks their smart speaker a question, the assistant typically cites one, single source. You want that to be yours. Here’s how you can do that: Read: ""How and Why to Optimize Your Website for Voice Search"" Local businesses face a unique AEO challenge: queries that seem non-local often surface local entities in AI-generated answers. For example, when someone asks “best coffee shop for remote work,” Google AI Overviews and voice assistants frequently respond with specific nearby options, pulling data from Google Business Profile and local landing pages. You're invisible in these high-intent moments if your local data is incomplete or inconsistent. Cover your bases by:  Source Loop marketing and AI engine optimization are natural partners in a modern content strategy. Traditional funnel marketing assumes buyers take a linear path from awareness to purchase, interacting in the same places, asking the same questions, and visiting the same pages. But today‘s buyers don’t move in straight lines, and they certainly don’t all take the same journey. Loop marketing recognizes this reality by designing for continuous engagement across multiple channels, rather than one-time conversion in one specific place.  You create content that serves customers before, during, and after the sale. Answering new questions as they arise, supporting expanded use cases, and nurturing advocacy that feeds back into awareness. You meet them on social media, forums, podcasts, through AI assistants, and a host of other platforms. When a satisfied customer asks ChatGPT, “How do I get more value from my marketing automation?” and your knowledge base article gets cited, you've stayed top-of-mind without waiting for them to remember your domain and navigate there manually. When prospects loop back to compare options and Google AI Overviews summarizes your competitor comparison guide, you've re-entered their consideration set. When new users ask voice assistants about getting started and your onboarding content gets recommended, you‘ve scaled customer success beyond your support team’s capacity. AEO is a crucial part of loop marketing and meeting modern buyers where they are.  Like SEO, AEO also involves the technical setup and performance of your website and content. That said, having some code knowledge or working with a developer on some points on this checklist is good. These tasks will ensure that answer engines can crawl, parse, and extract your content reliably. It’s baseline work that must be in place before advanced AEO tactics deliver results. If your answers, headings, or critical text load only via JavaScript (JS), many crawlers won't see them. Ensure your HTML contains actual content when the page first loads, not just empty divs waiting for JS to populate them. Mark headings with proper H1, H2, and H3 tags in logical hierarchy. Use <article>, <section>, and <aside> tags to clarify content structure. Wrap lists in <ul> or <ol> tags. Semantic HTML helps AI systems understand the relationships between different parts of your page. Answer engines favor content that loads quickly and doesn't frustrate users. Aim for Core Web Vitals that pass Google's thresholds: LCP under 2.5 seconds, FID under 100ms, CLS under 0.1. Compress images, minimize render-blocking resources, and use a CDN. A URL like /blog/what-is-inbound-marketing clearly signals what the content is about. A URL like /blog/post-47293 tells AI systems nothing, making your content harder to categorize and cite. Every page should have exactly one H1, while H2s divide the body into its major sections. From there, H3s and H4s should divide it further. Don‘t skip levels (H2 to H4) or use headers for styling instead of structure. This hierarchy is one of the strongest signals AI systems use to parse your content’s organization. When referencing related content, use anchor text that describes what the linked page is about, not generic phrases like “click here” or “learn more.” Internal links help AI systems map your content relationships and understand topic clusters. HubSpot's Content Hub and CMS Hub provide built-in tools to manage internal linking at scale and ensure every page connects logically to your broader content ecosystem. Test your page with JavaScript disabled. Can you still read your answers, navigate headings, and see essential information? If critical content disappears without JS, crawlers and assistive technologies can't access it either. Build a baseline experience that works without JavaScript, then enhance progressively. Believe it or not, the biggest barrier to AEO success isn‘t technical; it’s organizational. Getting internal buy-in from executives and stakeholders who are used to measuring success by clicks and conversions requires a fundamental reframing of what visibility means in an AI-first world. Solution: Frame AEO as brand awareness and category leadership, not traffic generation. When your content gets cited in thousands of ChatGPT answers or Google AI Overviews, you're shaping how buyers think about the problem space and which solutions they consider. This is top-of-funnel influence at scale, similar to PR, thought leadership, or sponsorships. Also, explain the shift in internet behavior and how website traffic is slowly becoming less of an indicator of actual brand prevalence. Explain how competitors who own AI visibility today will own mindshare tomorrow. Quantify the opportunity by tracking how often branded vs. non-branded answers appear for high-value queries, then demonstrate the cost of letting competitors fill that gap unchallenged. Solution: AI citations don't generate sessions in Google Analytics, so traditional tracking breaks down. Build a hybrid measurement framework that combines proxy metrics with directional indicators. For instance, track your share of featured snippets and PAA appearances over time using tools like HubSpot's AI Search Grader. Monitor branded search volume. If your AI visibility increases, you should see more people searching your brand name directly after encountering it in AI answers.  Also, survey new customers about how they first heard of you; increasingly, answers will reference “saw you mentioned in an AI search” or “found you when researching with ChatGPT.” Correlate AEO milestones with pipeline velocity and deal size to demonstrate business impact even when the path isn't linear. Solution: Most AI platforms don't provide “Search Console for LLMs,” where you can see when and how often you were cited. So, you’ll need to create a simple manual tracking system. Start by assigning a team member to periodically query major AI platforms (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Bing Chat) with your target questions and document when your brand appears. Log the query, platform, date, and whether you were the primary source or mentioned alongside competitors. This qualitative data helps you understand which content formats and topics earn the most AI visibility. Over time, patterns will emerge. Certain content types get cited more reliably, or specific platforms favor different answer structures. Use these insights to refine your AEO content strategy even without perfect analytics. Solution: Prioritize ruthlessly. AEO can feel like an overwhelming lift if you‘re trying to optimize thousands of existing pages at once. Start with your top 20 highest-traffic pages and the 20 pages that rank on page one but don’t yet win featured snippets. These are your highest-leverage opportunities. Add schema and answer-first formatting to these pages first. Then expand to pillar pages and core conversion content. Solution: Schema implementation is often the bottleneck because it requires collaboration between content creators who understand the information and developers who can implement JSON-LD correctly. Bridge this gap by creating schema templates that your content team can populate without writing code. Tools like Google's Schema Markup Generator or HubSpot's built-in schema modules let non-technical users add structured data through form fields. Pair this with a validation workflow where someone tests each page with Google's Rich Results Test before publishing. Over time, as your team sees the impact of schema on featured snippet wins and AI citations, they'll build fluency and confidence.

Solution: The way Google AI Overviews format answers today may differ from how they format them next quarter, and ChatGPT's citation behavior evolves with each model update. This unpredictability makes teams hesitant to invest, but hey, the volatility of search engines didn’t stop SEO from being a non-negotiable. Anchor your strategy in principles that remain stable regardless of algorithm changes: These fundamentals improve user experience and site performance even if AI algorithms shift. Instead of optimizing for a specific engine’s quirks, you're making your content universally understandable and valuable, which pays dividends across all discovery channels. Solution: This is a real concern, especially in regulated industries. AI systems sometimes paraphrase incorrectly or cite out of context. Mitigate this risk by being extremely precise in your answer's first paragraphs. If the first 60 words fully and accurately answer the question, there's less room for AI to misinterpret. Avoid nuance and caveats in your direct answers; save those for supporting paragraphs. For highly sensitive topics, consider whether you want to be cited at all. In these cases, you can use robots.txt rules to block certain AI crawlers, though this, of course, limits your visibility. Balance risk and opportunity with your legal team, and establish a monitoring process to flag and correct instances where your content is misrepresented in AI outputs. You can typically see early wins within 4-8 weeks, but meaningful momentum builds over 6-12 months. The timeline depends on your starting point and how aggressively you implement changes. If you‘re starting from scratch, expect to spend the first month mapping questions, auditing existing content, and implementing schema on priority pages. By week 6-8, pages with newly added structured data often begin appearing in featured snippets or PAA boxes. You might also notice your brand mentioned in AI-generated answers when you manually test queries, though this won’t appear in traditional analytics. Like traditional SEO, the 3-6 month window is where compounding effects start. As you publish more answer-optimized content and build off-site authority, your brand becomes a more trusted source across multiple topics. You'll win more featured snippets, get cited in more AI summaries, and see branded search volume tick upward as people become aware of your brand and later search for you directly. After 6-12 months of regularly publishing AEO-optimized content, building authority, and refreshing existing pages with new PAA questions, you should see measurable business impact. Pipeline influenced by AI visibility is growing, customer surveys increasingly mention discovering you through AI tools, and your share of AI citations in your category becomes a competitive advantage. Pro tip: Set realistic expectations with stakeholders: AEO is not a quick-win tactic. It's a strategic investment in long-term visibility and authority as the internet shifts toward answer-based discovery. Early wins validate the approach, but sustained commitment is required to dominate your category in AI-mediated experiences. No, but you should prioritize schema on pages where structured data delivers the most impact. Not all pages benefit equally, and trying to add schema everywhere at once creates unnecessary work without proportional return. Start with pages that fit the FAQPage schema, followed by Article, Speakable, and Organization. Depending on your offerings, product and service pages can also include relevant schema types like Product, Service, or LocalBusiness. These help AI systems understand what you sell, where you operate, and how to present your business in local results and voice answers. HubSpot's CMS Hub makes adding schema automatic with templates. You don't need expensive enterprise software to begin tracking your AEO performance. Start with a simple spreadsheet and a manual audit process, then layer in free or low-cost tools as you scale. Create a tracking log with these columns: date, query, AI platform (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews, Bing Chat), your brand mentioned (yes/no), cited as primary source (yes/no), competitor mentioned, and notes. Assign someone on your team to query 10-15 high-priority questions across multiple AI platforms each week. Document whether your brand appears in the answer, how prominently, and what content gets cited. This qualitative tracking reveals patterns. Certain topics earn more visibility, specific content formats get cited more often, or particular platforms favor your brand over competitors. Use HubSpot's AI Search Grader to get a baseline assessment of your AI visibility across key queries. This free tool shows where you're already appearing in AI-generated answers and identifies opportunities to improve. Combine this with Google Search Console to track featured snippet wins and PAA appearances; while these aren‘t exactly AI citations, they’re strong proxy metrics for content that AI systems find extract-worthy. Set up branded search monitoring in Google Analytics 4. If your AEO efforts increase awareness, you should see more users searching your brand name directly after encountering it in AI answers. Create a custom report that tracks branded organic sessions, new users from branded queries, and conversions from branded traffic. Increases here suggest your AI visibility translates to downstream business value even when the original discovery happened outside your website. As your AEO program matures and you need more sophisticated tracking, consider platforms built for AI visibility measurement. However, in the early stages, a disciplined manual process and smart use of free tools provide more than enough insight to guide strategy and demonstrate progress to stakeholders. No. AI engine optimization and search engine optimization are complementary, not competitive. Both are essential for maximum visibility in an AI-augmented search landscape, and trying to choose one over the other leaves significant opportunity on the table. Off and on-page SEO remain foundational because they determine whether AI systems discover your content in the first place. Language models and answer engines crawl the web the same way traditional search engines do. If your site has poor technical health, slow load times, or weak domain authority, AI systems won't index your content deeply or trust it enough to cite it. Strong SEO fundamentals (e.g., fast pages, clean HTML, authoritative backlinks, and crawlable structure) are prerequisites for AEO success. Invest in both. AEO content requires ongoing maintenance because AI systems prioritize recency and accuracy. Outdated answers hurt your credibility and reduce the likelihood of being cited. AEO content isn't “set it and forget it.” Treat it like a living knowledge base that evolves with your business and the questions your audience asks. The brands that commit to continuous refinement will maintain AI visibility as algorithms and user behavior shift over time. So, how’s my identity crisis going today? Thankfully, the more I learn about AEO, the quieter that panic becomes. Because those old skills that helped me top search engines still matter, they’re just evolving. AEO isn’t about throwing out what we know; it’s about translating it for a new era. The same instincts that helped us master SEO — curiosity, clarity, structure, and empathy for the reader — are the same ones that will help us thrive in an AI-driven search landscape. So instead of panicking about losing control of the click, focus on earning trust in the answer. Because at the end of the day, that’s still what great marketing has always been about.

  At 28, I thought I was building the life I’d always dreamed of. I got engaged, shared it with my audience, and then brought them along on the journey. Over 10 million people watched my “Get Married With Me” video across my platforms. It was one of the most beautiful moments of my life, magnified by the fact that I had built this level of trust and connection with my community.  But a year later, I wasn’t preparing for another celebration. I was preparing for a divorce. The person I had married misrepresented who they were on nearly every level. Behind the curated moments and public smiles was a predatory relationship. I took what could have been my deepest humiliation and turned it into a story of resilience. I launched my “Married at 28. Divorcing at 29” TikTok series. I wasn’t sensationalizing my heartbreak. Instead, I was reclaiming the narrative and processing what had happened to me in the most honest way possible. Here’s why I decided to share my experience and how the experience shaped my career as an influencer.

I decided to go public about my divorce because, as a creator who prides herself on authenticity, I don’t believe in only sharing the good and hiding the bad. My audience saw my engagement, my wedding prep, and even the most intimate moments leading up to the big day. To omit the ending would have felt dishonest.  Authenticity is what has helped me secure brand partnerships, and I view it as my duty to show the full spectrum of my story. What I’ve found is that the best brands don’t shy away from what’s real. Instead, they embrace it. In fact, many of the opportunities that have come my way have been from brands drawn to my unfiltered storytelling. When I announced my divorce, I didn’t do it in a breakdown video. I did it in partnership with OSEA – a skincare brand I genuinely love. The tagline was simple: “Glowing Through Divorce.” In my campaign with OSEA, I was able to weave my real-life journey into the promotion of their products.  Source These are the collaborations that resonate most, because they aren’t manufactured. They are born out of alignment. When they recognize that authenticity sells, brands are rewarded for their honesty with audience trust. My partnership with OSEA wasn’t just marketing. It was a declaration. I was showing my audience that even in the middle of betrayal, deception, and pain, I could choose light. I could choose to nourish myself, to take care of my body and spirit, and to glow from within. And that’s what people connected with. Not the perfection of my past, but the courage to live in the truth of the present.  Since I began telling my story, tens of thousands of women have reached out to share their own. Some even confided that my transparency gave them the courage to finally leave abusive, narcissistic, and predatory relationships. Others admitted they hadn’t even realized they were in one until my videos gave them language for their experience. Men, too, have reached out — many recognizing the patterns of deception, gaslighting, and emotional sabotage in their own lives. The messages flood in daily. Comments pour in on every post. And what I’ve realized is this: When you speak truth, you give others permission to do the same. You create connection not just through relatability, but through liberation. That is why audiences resonate so deeply with this story. Because it doesn’t just entertain … it validates. It reminds people they aren’t alone. That exposure is often the first step toward freedom. And from a professional standpoint, my experience reinforced one of the most important lessons of my career: honesty creates community, and community creates longevity. My credibility as a creator hasn’t been damaged by sharing my divorce. In fact, it has been strengthened. Brands haven’t pulled back because of my vulnerability. They’ve leaned in. They’ve seen that authenticity deepens trust, and trust is the currency of influence. That’s why partnerships like my campaign with OSEA announcing my divorce resonated so strongly. When content is rooted in truth, it doesn’t just sell products — it builds belief. This season of my life has been a personal reckoning, but it has also been one of my greatest professional case studies. Here’s what I’ve learned:  I got married at 28 and began getting divorced at 29. I was entrapped in marriage fraud. But by exposing the truth, I turned what could have been my greatest shame into my greatest source of power. This isn’t just about divorce. It’s about the freedom that comes from living authentically, from speaking the unspeakable, and from refusing to let someone else write your story. There’s a lesson here that extends beyond personal life: Truth builds trust. What I lived through was predatory and deceptive, but the way I shared it became strategic. People didn’t just watch for updates. They watched because they saw themselves reflected back. They found courage in the cracks of my story. And that bond — raw, unfiltered, undeniable — is why my content didn’t just withstand the storm. It grew. That bond is also why brands have been eager to work with me. Credibility in today’s landscape doesn’t come from projecting a façade. It comes from living in your truth. When people see you own that truth, they don’t just follow you — they invest in you.

  TL;DR: Machine learning in email marketing uses algorithms to personalize content, optimize send times, and predict customer behavior — driving higher engagement and revenue. Email marketing has evolved from batch-and-blast campaigns to sophisticated, data-driven experiences. Machine learning algorithms analyze patterns, predict behavior, and personalize email marketing at scale. Not every ML application delivers results, and teams often find it hard to distinguish between hype and impactful use cases.  This guide cuts through the noise. You‘ll learn effective machine learning strategies, how to prepare your data, and how to implement ML features in phases, whether you’re a solo marketer or leading a team. We'll also discuss common pitfalls that waste time and budget and provide practical steps to measure ROI and maintain brand integrity. Table of Contents Machine learning in email marketing uses algorithms to analyze past data like open rates and click behavior to predict and automate decisions for each contact. Unlike rules-based automation (if contact X does Y, send email Z), ML models find patterns humans can't spot manually and adapt as new data arrives. It's distinct from general AI in two ways: ML is narrowly focused on prediction and pattern recognition, while AI encompasses broader capabilities such as natural language understanding and generation. And unlike static segmentation rules you write once, ML models continuously refine their predictions as they ingest more engagement signals. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Machine learning shines when you have clean, unified data, clear success metrics, and enough volume to train models. It falls short when data quality is poor, goals are vague, or you expect it to replace strategic thinking. Most machine learning failures occur before the first model is run. Poor data quality, fragmented contact records, and missing consent flags will sabotage even the smartest algorithms. Before you enable ML features, invest in these foundational steps.  Machine learning models need a single source of truth. If your contact data lives in multiple systems — email platform, CRM, ecommerce backend, support desk — models can't see the full picture. A contact who abandoned a cart, opened three emails, and called support last week looks like three separate people unless you unify those records. Start by consolidating contacts into one system that tracks identity, lifecycle stage, and behavioral events on a shared timeline. Map key activities — form submissions, purchases, support tickets, content downloads — to lifecycle stages like Subscriber, Lead, Marketing Qualified Lead, Opportunity, and Customer. This mapping gives ML models the context they need to predict next actions. Identity resolution matters here: if john.doe@company.com and j.doe@company.com are the same person, merge them. If a contact switches from a personal to a work email, link those identities. The more complete each contact record, the better your models perform. HubSpot Smart CRM automatically unifies contacts, tracks engagement across channels, and maintains a single timeline for every interaction — giving your ML models the clean, connected data they need to personalize effectively. Before you train models, clean your data. Deduplicate contacts, standardize field formatting (lowercase emails, consistent country names, formatted phone numbers), and tag consent status for every record. If 15% of your contacts have duplicate entries or missing lifecycle stages, your segmentation and scoring models will misfire. Set up automated workflows to: Manual cleanup is a temporary fix. Automate quality checks so new records arrive clean and existing records stay accurate as they age. Data quality automation in Operations Hub reduces errors, prevents duplicates, and keeps consent flags up to date, ensuring your ML models train on reliable signals rather than noise. ML models learn from behavior, not just static attributes. If you're not tracking key events—email opens, link clicks, page views, purchases, downloads, demo requests—your models will lack the signals they need to predict engagement or conversion. Audit your event schema: Are you capturing the events that matter to your business? Can you tie each event back to a specific contact? Do events carry enough context (product viewed, dollar value, content type) to inform personalization? Fix gaps by instrumenting your website, email platform, and product with consistent event tracking. Use UTM parameters and tracking pixels to attribute conversions back to specific campaigns and contacts. The richer your event data, the sharper your predictions. You can‘t measure ML’s impact without a baseline. Before you enable any machine learning feature, document your current performance: Run a holdout test if possible: apply ML to a treatment group and compare results to a control group receiving your standard approach. This isolates ML's impact from seasonality, external campaigns, or changes in your audience. Track these metrics over at least two to three campaign cycles post-launch so you can distinguish signal from noise. Quick wins like send-time optimization may show results in weeks; longer-term gains like predictive scoring and churn prevention compound over months. Not all machine learning applications deliver equal value. These use cases have the strongest track records across industries and team sizes. For each, we'll explain what it does, when it works best, and the most common mistake to avoid. What it does: Machine learning selects content blocks, images, product recommendations, or calls-to-action for each recipient based on their profile and behavior. Instead of creating separate campaigns for every segment, you design one template with multiple variants, and the model chooses the best combination per contact. When it works best: High-volume campaigns with diverse audiences — newsletters, onboarding sequences, promotional emails. You need enough historical engagement data (opens, clicks, conversions) for the model to learn which content resonates with which profiles. Common mistake: Personalizing for the sake of personalization. Just because you can swap in a contact‘s first name or company doesn’t mean it improves outcomes. Personalize elements that change decision-making — offers, product recommendations, social proof — not cosmetic details. Test personalized vs. static versions to confirm lift. Pro tip: For faster content creation, use HubSpot's AI email writer to generate personalized email copy at scale, or tap the AI email copy generator to create campaign-specific messaging that adapts to your audience segments. What it does: Instead of sending every email at 10 a.m. Tuesday, a send-time optimization model predicts the hour each contact is most likely to open and engage, then schedules delivery accordingly. The model learns from each contact's historical open patterns—time of day, day of week, device type—and adjusts over time. When it works best: Campaigns where timing flexibility doesn't hurt your message (newsletters, nurture sequences, promotional announcements). Less useful for time-sensitive emails like webinar reminders or flash sales where everyone needs to receive the message within a tight window. Common mistake: Assuming optimal send time alone will transform results. Send-time optimization typically lifts open rates by 5–15%, not 100%. It's a marginal gain that compounds over many sends. Pair it with strong subject lines, relevant content, and healthy list hygiene for maximum impact. HubSpot Marketing Hub email marketing includes send-time optimization that analyzes engagement history and automatically schedules emails when each contact is most likely to open. What it does: Predictive scoring models analyze hundreds of attributes—job title, company size, website visits, email engagement, content downloads—to assign each contact a score representing their likelihood to convert or churn. High scores go to sales or receive more aggressive nurture; low scores get lighter-touch campaigns or re-engagement sequences. When it works best: B2B companies with defined sales funnels and enough closed deals to train the model (typically 200+ closed-won and closed-lost opportunities). Also effective in B2C subscription businesses for identifying churn risk before cancellation. Common mistake: Trusting the score without validating it. Models can be biased by outdated assumptions (e.g., overweighting job titles that were once strong signals but no longer correlate with conversion). Regularly compare predicted scores to actual outcomes and retrain when accuracy drifts. Predictive lead scoring in HubSpot builds and updates scoring models automatically using your closed deals and contact data. It surfaces the contacts most likely to convert, so your team focuses effort where it matters most. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. What it does: ML models analyze thousands of past subject lines and email bodies to identify patterns that drive opens and clicks. Some platforms generate subject line variants and preview text, then run multivariate tests faster than manual A/B testing. Others suggest improvements based on high-performing language patterns. When it works best: High-send-volume programs where you can test multiple variants per campaign and learn quickly. Less effective if your list is small (under 5,000 contacts) or you send infrequently, because you won't generate enough data to distinguish signal from noise. Common mistake: Letting the model write everything. ML can accelerate testing and surface winning patterns, but it doesn't understand your brand voice or strategic positioning. Use AI-generated copy as a starting point, then edit for tone, compliance, and brand consistency. Generate subject lines for marketing emails with HubSpot AI to quickly create multiple variants for testing, and generate preview text for marketing emails to complete the optimization. For broader campaign support, the Breeze AI Suite offers AI-assisted copy and testing workflows that integrate across your marketing hub. Pro tip: Want deeper guidance on AI-powered email? Check out AI email marketing strategies and how to use AI for cold emails for practical frameworks and real-world examples. What it does: Recommendation engines predict which products, content pieces, or resources each contact will find most relevant based on their browsing history, past purchases, and the behavior of similar users. In ecommerce, this might be “customers who bought X also bought Y.” In B2B, it could be “contacts who downloaded this ebook also attended this webinar.” When it works best: Catalogs with at least 20–30 items and enough transaction or engagement volume to identify patterns. Works especially well in post-purchase emails, browse abandonment campaigns, and content nurture sequences. Common mistake: Recommending products the contact already owns or content they've already consumed. Exclude purchased items and viewed content from recommendations, and prioritize complementary or next-step offers instead. HubSpot Marketing Hub email marketing enables you to build dynamic recommendation blocks that pull from your product catalog or content library and personalize based on contact behavior. Pro tip: For more advanced tactics, explore how AI improves email conversions and how to localize AI-generated emails for global audiences. Vanity metrics like open rates and click-through rates tell you what happened, not whether it mattered. To prove ML's value, tie email performance to business outcomes to metrics like revenue, pipeline, customer retention, and lifetime value. Open and click rates are useful diagnostics, but they‘re not goals. A 30% open rate means nothing if those opens don’t drive purchases, signups, or qualified leads. Reframe your measurement around outcomes: Compare ML-driven campaigns to your baseline on these metrics. If send-time optimization lifts revenue per email by 12%, that's a clear win even if open rate only improved by 6%. Machine learning personalization and recommendations influence buying decisions across multiple touchpoints. To measure their impact accurately, implement multi-touch attribution that credits email alongside other channels. Use first-touch, last-touch, and linear attribution models to understand how email contributes to the customer journey. For example, if a contact receives a personalized product recommendation email, clicks through, browses but doesn't buy, then converts after a retargeting ad, email deserves partial credit. HubSpot Smart CRM tracks every interaction on a unified timeline and attributes revenue to the campaigns, emails, and touchpoints that influenced each deal—so you can see which ML-driven emails actually drive pipeline and closed revenue, not just clicks. The cleanest way to measure ML's ROI is a holdout experiment: split your audience into treatment (ML-enabled) and control (standard approach) groups, then compare performance over time. This isolates ML's impact from seasonality, external campaigns, or audience shifts. For example, enable predictive lead scoring for 70% of your database and continue manual scoring for the other 30%. After three months, compare conversion rates, sales cycle length, and deal size between the two groups. If the ML group converts 18% faster with 10% higher deal values, you've proven ROI. Run holdouts for 4–8 weeks minimum to smooth out weekly volatility. Rotate contacts between groups periodically to ensure fairness and avoid long-term bias. ROI isn‘t just revenue — it’s also time saved and costs avoided. Machine learning reduces manual work, accelerates testing cycles, and improves targeting accuracy, all of which translate to lower cost per acquisition and higher team productivity. Measure: If your team launches 40% more campaigns per quarter with the same headcount, or reduces cost per lead by 22%, those efficiency gains compound over time. Machine learning optimizes toward the goals you set, but it can also produce unintended side effects. Monitor: Set up dashboards that track both positive metrics (revenue, conversion) and negative indicators (unsubscribes, complaints, low engagement) so you catch problems early. Context matters. A 25% open rate might be excellent in financial services and mediocre in ecommerce. Compare your ML-driven results to: Don't chase industry averages—chase improvement over your own baseline and alignment with your business goals. You don‘t need enterprise resources to start with machine learning. The key is phasing in use cases that match your team’s capacity, data maturity, and technical sophistication. Here‘s an example of how to roll out ML in email marketing whether you’re a team of one or a hundred. Profile: 1–5 marketers, limited technical resources, sending 5–20 campaigns per month. You need quick wins that don't require custom development or data science expertise. Enable send-time optimization for your next three campaigns. It requires no new content creation, no segmentation changes, and no model training on your part—the platform learns from existing engagement data. Measure open rate lift vs. your standard send time and track conversions to confirm value. Pro tip: Add AI-assisted subject line and preview text generation to speed up campaign creation. Test two to three variants per send and let the model identify patterns. Introduce dynamic content personalization in your newsletter or nurture sequences. Start with one or two content blocks (hero image, CTA, featured resource) and create three to five variants. Let the model choose the best match per recipient. Track click-through and conversion rates by variant to validate performance. Enable predictive lead scoring if you have enough closed deals (aim for 200+ won and lost opportunities). Use scores to segment your email sends—high scorers get sales follow-up, mid-range contacts get nurture, low scorers get re-engagement or suppression. Assign one owner to review ML performance weekly: Are models still accurate? Are unsubscribe rates stable? Is brand voice consistent in AI-generated copy? Set approval gates for AI-generated subject lines and body copy—human review before every send. This prevents tone drift and catches errors the model misses. HubSpot Marketing Hub email marketing is built for small teams who want ML capabilities without needing a data science background—send-time optimization, AI copy assistance, and dynamic personalization work out of the box. Try Breeze AI free to access AI-powered email tools and see results in your first campaign. Profile: 6–20 marketers, some technical support, sending 30–100 campaigns per month across multiple segments and customer lifecycle stages. You're ready to layer sophistication and scale personalization. Roll out predictive lead scoring across your entire database and integrate scores into your email workflows. Use scores to trigger campaigns: leads who hit a threshold get routed to sales or receive a high-intent nurture sequence; contacts whose scores drop get win-back campaigns. Implement segment-level personalization in your core nurture tracks. Map lifecycle stages (Subscriber, Lead, MQL, Opportunity, Customer) to tailored content blocks and offers. Track conversion rate from each stage to the next and compare to your pre-ML baseline. Add dynamic product or content recommendations to post-purchase emails, browse abandonment sequences, and monthly newsletters. Use behavioral signals (pages viewed, products clicked, content downloaded) to power recommendations. Expand AI-assisted copy testing to all major campaigns. Generate five to seven subject line variants per send, run multivariate tests, and let the model surface winners. Build a library of high-performing patterns (questions, urgency phrases, personalization tokens) to inform future campaigns. Establish a bi-weekly ML review meeting with campaign managers, marketing ops, and a data point person. Review model accuracy, performance trends, and any anomalies (sudden drops in engagement, unexpected segment behavior). Create a brand voice checklist for AI-generated copy: Does it match our tone? Does it avoid jargon? Does it align with our positioning? Require checklist sign-off before major sends. Set up A/B tests with holdouts for new ML features before full rollout. Test on 20% of your audience, validate results, then scale to everyone. Predictive lead scoring gives mid-market teams the prioritization and orchestration they need to focus on high-value contacts without adding headcount. The model updates automatically as new deals close, so your scoring stays accurate as your business evolves. Profile: 20+ marketers, dedicated marketing ops and data teams, sending 100+ campaigns per month across regions, business units, and customer segments. You need governance, compliance, and scalability. Establish data contracts and governance frameworks before you scale ML. Define which teams own contact data, event schemas, and model outputs. Document consent management rules, data retention policies, and privacy obligations by region (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). Launch cross-functional ML council with representatives from marketing, legal, data engineering, and product. Meet monthly to review model performance, address bias concerns, and approve new use cases. Roll out predictive scoring and churn models at the business unit level. Customize scoring for each product line or region if your customer profiles differ significantly. Track accuracy and retrain quarterly. Deploy advanced personalization across all email programs: onboarding, nurture, promotional, transactional. Use behavioral, firmographic, and intent signals to drive content selection. Build a centralized content library with tagged variants (industry, persona, stage) that models can pull from dynamically. Implement automated bias and fairness checks in your ML pipelines. Monitor whether certain segments (by region, company size, job function) receive systematically different content or scoring. Adjust model features and training data to correct imbalances. Expand AI copy assistance to international teams. Generate and test localized subject lines and body copy in each market, then share winning patterns across regions. Mandate human-in-the-loop review for all AI-generated copy in high-stakes campaigns (product launches, executive communications, crisis response). Require legal and compliance sign-off for campaigns targeting regulated industries (healthcare, financial services). Run quarterly model audits to validate accuracy, check for drift, and retrain on updated data. Publish audit results internally to maintain trust and transparency. Set up rollback procedures for underperforming models. If a new scoring model or personalization engine degrades performance, revert to the prior version within 24 hours and conduct a post-mortem. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT. Even well-resourced teams make predictable mistakes when deploying machine learning in email marketing. Here are the most common pitfalls and one-line fixes for each. No, you don‘t need a data scientist to start if you use platforms with embedded machine learning. Tools like HubSpot’s predictive lead scoring, send-time optimization, and AI-assisted copy generation handle model training, tuning, and deployment automatically. You don't write code or tune hyperparameters; you configure settings, review results, and adjust based on performance. That said, deeper expertise helps when you want to: Start with out-of-the-box ML features. Bring in a data scientist or ML engineer only when you've exhausted platform capabilities and have a specific, high-value use case that requires custom modeling. Cleaner is better, but you don't need perfection. Aim for these pragmatic thresholds before you launch ML features: If your data falls short of these bars, prioritize incremental improvements. Fix the highest-impact issues first—deduplication, consent flags, and lifecycle stage tagging—then layer in event tracking and enrichment over time. Don't wait for perfect data; start with good-enough data and improve as you go. It depends on the use case and your send volume: Quick wins (2–4 weeks): Medium-term gains (1–3 months): Long-term compounding (3–6 months): Set realistic expectations with stakeholders: ML isn‘t magic. It’s a compounding advantage that improves with volume, iteration, and data quality over time. Roles: Rituals: Guardrails: Start simple: one owner, one reviewer, and a weekly 15-minute check-in. Add governance layers as your ML footprint expands. The future of email marketing machine learning isn‘t more automation — it’s smarter integration. Models will pull from richer data sources (CRM, product usage, support interactions, intent signals) to predict not just whether someone will open an email, but what they need next and when they're ready to act. Look to the path forward: unify your data, start with proven use cases, measure ruthlessly, and govern with intention. Machine learning in email marketing isn‘t hype — it’s infrastructure. The teams that build it now will compound advantages for years. Create, personalize, and optimize your marketing emails without waiting on designers or IT.

  Every January, I sit down to write my predictions for the year ahead in social media and consumer behavior. And this year, one trend stood out to me more than anything else: the rise of customers as influencers.  In the past 18 months, we’ve seen people boycotting brands, blocking campaigns, and becoming much more marketing literate. We know how influencer deals work, we see the behind-the-scenes, and in many cases we now view influencers as brands themselves. That changes how we trust them, and how we want to engage. It’s made me stop and think: what if customers are the new influencers? This article is about that shift. Why consumers are growing tired of influencer culture, what happens when brands put their customers in the spotlight instead, and how any business — big or small — can start building a customer influencer strategy of their own. Because in 2025, I believe the smartest brands will be the ones who give their customers the microphone. Table of Contents Plan your content strategically with these handy templates. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Over the past year or so, the sentiment around influencers has changed. At the start of 2024 we saw the “blockout” after the Met Gala — entire communities boycotting brands and creators at once.    Source For me, that moment showed just how powerful consumers have become, and how different the brand–consumer relationship looks now compared to just a few years ago. You see this play out around big cultural moments like Coachella. I remember watching one influencer’s White Fox gifting haul where she casually pulled a Dyson Airwrap out of the bag. Half the comments were people saying, “Wow, I wish this life would find me,” and the other half were angry, calling it a “disgusting display of not just wealth but opportunity.” It was so telling of the split between aspiration and alienation. That’s also why REFI Beauty’s approach felt so refreshing. Instead of flying out influencers for another glossy trip, they invited their own customers on a community holiday to launch a new collection. If influencers are now brands themselves, then maybe customers are the ones best placed to carry the trust, authenticity, and connection that traditional influencer marketing has lost. I’m not saying we should ditch influencers entirely — they still have a place. But I do think there’s something really powerful about bringing customers into the spotlight. When brands do this, the benefits are clear. One of my favorite examples is Toco Swim, a London-based swimwear brand run by two sisters. Instead of hiring influencers or models, they invited their own customers to model their new summer collection. They shared behind-the-scenes on Instagram, gave people the chance to try on pieces, and I’m sure those who took part got to take a few products home. For the brand, it meant gorgeous content and big savings on model fees. For the customers, it was an experience with a brand they already loved. I remember thinking, that’s incredible — maybe that could be me next time if I’m brave enough. Snag, a Scottish-based hosiery brand, takes a different approach. They don’t work with influencers at all. Instead, they comb through their tagged posts and reach out to customers whose content they like. They’ll pay those people a small fee for the rights, and suddenly their entire grid is filled with real customers.  Source For the brand, it’s a cost-effective way to source authentic content. For the customer, it’s exciting and validating — who wouldn’t want to be featured by a brand they love?! And once you’ve been spotlighted, you’re likely to post about the brand even more. Here’s the thing: if a brand featured me, I’d tell my friends, I’d tell my co-workers, I’d post it on my own grid. Sure, maybe that only reaches ten people. But those ten people know me. They trust me. They’ve seen me wear the product in real life. That kind of ripple effect feels more powerful than a stranger with 100,000 followers telling me to buy something. The other big benefit is loyalty. Featuring customers shows them you value their support, and that matters. When people feel recognized, they stick around. They spend more, they engage more, and they tell their friends. It’s personalization in the truest sense — not an algorithm guessing what I want, but a brand showing me I’m part of their story. For me, that’s the real opportunity here. Using your customers in this way is a smart way to build deeper, lasting relationships. Plan your content strategically with these handy templates. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. If you’re a smaller brand, this might sound intimidating. But getting started doesn’t have to be complicated — or expensive. Here are a few ways I’ve seen it work well: The first step is creating one clear place where your audience knows they can go for opportunities. It could be an Instagram broadcast channel like REFI Beauty use, where they share links to apply for community trips or sign-ups for events. Or it could be a simple landing page, like Coco Kind has, where customers register once and are automatically entered into future raffles.  Source The important thing is consistency. Your customers shouldn’t have to search across ten channels wondering how they can get involved. Think about what you want these opportunities to look like. Do you want them to be part of your content, like Toco Swim’s photo shoots? Do you want to swap out influencer gifting trips for customer trips, like Coco Kind? Or do you want to highlight people virtually, like The Productivity Method does with their “Day in the Life” grid takeovers? There isn’t one right way — it’s about choosing what feels most natural for your brand. Sometimes the best ideas come directly from your customers. I love the “IKEA effect,” which basically says people value something more if they feel like they helped build it. So why not ask them? You could run a series of Instagram stories, create a LinkedIn poll, or send out an email that simply says: “We want to involve you more — what would make this valuable for you?” I can picture the responses now: ideas for trips, content formats, events you wouldn’t have even thought of. And honestly, your customers are often far more creative than you are. I can imagine a whole campaign built this way — sharing back the submissions, spotlighting community suggestions, and letting people vote on what excites them. Not only do you end up with amazing ideas to work with, but you also create this sense of co-ownership. Customers start to feel like they’re part of the brand instead of just buyers of a product. Not every business can afford to fly their customers to Spain for a launch. And that’s okay! Virtual opportunities can be just as powerful. Think story takeovers, day-in-the-life content, or simple features on your grid. I’ve seen brands spotlight customers on their feed with tags and shout-outs, and honestly, that recognition goes a long way. Even a small slice of your online presence (like an Instagram post, a story highlight, or a LinkedIn feature) can mean everything to the people who love your brand. Finally, think about what you can offer in return. It might be a free product, early access, or even a small payment for content rights like Snag does. The point isn’t to create a polished influencer-style contract; it’s to show your customers that you value their time and creativity. That recognition is what keeps people coming back, posting more, and becoming long-term advocates. At the end of the day, it comes down to giving your customers space in your brand story. Whether that’s physical (through trips or shoots) or digital (through takeovers and features), it’s about handing them real estate in your presence and letting them shine. I don’t think influencers are disappearing anytime soon, but I do think 2025 is the year customers finally get their moment. The past year has shown us just how much power people hold when they block, boycott, or call out brands, and honestly, I find that fascinating. If we can channel that same energy into positive, community-driven opportunities, everyone wins. For me, this whole idea came from a very real place: scrolling TikTok, seeing the backlash to lavish gifting hauls, and then watching brands like REFI, Toco Swim, and Snag do things differently. It felt fresh. It felt exciting. It made me think, maybe that could be me next time. That’s the heart of it: giving your customers a chance to feel seen, to feel valued, and to feel like they’re part of your story. When you do that, you’re not just filling a content calendar — you’re building real trust and lasting loyalty. And as someone who lives and breathes this space, I truly believe the smartest brands in 2025 will be the ones who hand over the spotlight to the people who already love them most.

  Something’s been throwing marketers for a loop lately. (Eye-roll level pun very much intended.)  Instead of turning to Google for the answers to all their curiosities and questions, consumers are increasingly watching YouTube reviews, asking ChatGPT for recommendations, scrolling through social feeds, and messaging influencers instead. Meanwhile, AI search engines are serving up “summarized” direct answers to them instead of sending them to your website. What are we to do? A Loop Marketing strategy can help you navigate this new era of AI and audience behavior. This guide will explain Loop Marketing, introduce you to the playbook, and detail how to create a Loop Marketing strategy that meets modern buyers where they are. Table of Contents Loop Marketing is a new way to grow — powered by humans and AI, working together to express your message, tailor it to your audience, amplify it across channels, and evolve it in real time. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Loop Marketing is a cyclical, four-stage strategy — Express, Tailor, Amplify, Evolve — where teams learn from every customer interaction to improve their campaigns and combine human creativity with AI and unified data. Unlike linear funnel approaches to marketing, which are typically static, Loop Marketing adapts in real time and personalizes at scale. To implement: define your brand and ideal customer profile (Express), personalize every touchpoint (Tailor), distribute and optimize for multiple channels, including AI search (Amplify), and measure, learn, and iterate quickly (Evolve). Start by identifying your biggest gap and use unified tools like HubSpot’s Smart CRM and Breeze AI to accelerate each stage. Ready to modernize your marketing? Start free. Loop Marketing is a four-stage approach to promoting a brand or business (Express, Tailor, Amplify, Evolve) that learns from every interaction and unites human creativity with AI and unified data. It turns the marketing funnel on its head — but not literally. Rather, it transforms the funnel into an endless cycle that immediately implements what it’s learned from the last campaign with the help of AI. While older “funnel” approaches to marketing assume buyers take a pretty set path from awareness to purchase, Loop Marketing recognizes modern buyers engage across multiple touchpoints and can take very different journeys through them. It also considers the impact of AI on search and buyer behavior, taking advantage of real-time feedback and AI-powered insights to deliver experiences that truly feel personal to each customer, in hopes of increasing conversions. Here’s a quick peek at what that looks like through the four stages: Sure, these aren’t necessarily new tactics, but Loop Marketing outlines them in a new way to facilitate fast and consistent improvement. How is this different from other methodologies exactly? Understanding the distinctions between loop, funnel, and closed-loop is crucial for modern marketers. Knowing their differences and similarities helps clarify when each strategy makes sense and perhaps what needs to change for your team. Funnel Marketing Models (like early inbound marketing) serve as helpful marketing frameworks, focusing on moving prospects through linear stages. While these models provide structure and an understanding of the buyer’s journey, they don’t really reflect the marketer’s workflow.  Loop Marketing follows the buyer’s journey, but recognizes the need for marketers to stay dynamic, measure campaign performance, and implement changes immediately — hence showcasing it as an endless cycle. Closed-loop marketing is simply a measurement practice, not a strategy. It connects marketing activities to revenue outcomes (often called closed-loop reporting), which is valuable, of course, but not a tactical approach to executing marketing.  Source Depending on your metrics, this type of reporting can actually be an important part of the Evolve stage of the Loop or funnel marketing, so it’s kind of misguided to compare them. Overall, I’d argue that Loop Marketing combines the best parts of funnel and closed-loop marketing into the modern strategy businesses need to stay competitive. Many businesses forget it, but marketing is for your buyers, not for you. Buyers have changed a lot, especially in the last few years, so your marketing needs to change with them. People today find and buy products on social media. They also get information through video platforms, online communities, and conversational AI assistants. Even the old search engines we know and love have incorporated AI summaries that provide direct answers rather than just links.  Buyer attention and awareness scatter across multiple platforms, and their journey to purchase is rarely linear. They’re also craving more personalized experiences from brands and businesses. Traditional marketing funnels struggle to account for this complexity. Enter on white horse: Loop Marketing. Loop Marketing can outperform static campaigns because it can adapt to changing patterns in real time, incorporating AI insights and feedback. It enables faster time-to-market through AI-assisted content creation, personalization at scale with intelligent segmentation, lower acquisition costs through smarter targeting, and compounding learnings that make each campaign cycle more effective than the last. Loop Marketing doesn't just react to change — it anticipates and adapts.

Note: We’re just going to scratch the surface here. Check our free Loop Marketing Playbook and AI prompts to dive deeper into each step.  In this stage, you’re basically gathering all of the background information AI will need to create on-brand and effective content for you. That means solidifying your ideal customer and brand identity. Here’s what you need to do at a high level: Bonus: Build a content template Library: Develop reusable frameworks for different content types. Next, you’re taking those campaign and content ideas and making them feel personal to your audience, not just personalized. That means using AI insights to deliver different messages, CTAs, and experiences based on what’s most relevant to that specific person. Your to-dos: Pro tip: Have human quality assurance in place. While AI’s speed is undeniable, its accuracy is still a work in progress. (More on that shortly) Make sure your team is ready to spot-check and humanize any AI work. Learn more about how to do this in our article, “How to Humanize AI Content So It Will Rank, Engage, and Get Shared in 2025.” Modern buyers' attention is highly divided. They watch videos on YouTube and social media, ask questions to ChatGPT, text friends, and message creators, sometimes all at once. That’s why this stage is about diversifying your channels and meeting your buyers where they actually are. Was something in your campaign a hit? Awesome. Was something else a bust? You’ll get ‘em next time, slugger. The Evolve stage uses AI to track performance, gather these insights, and develop a real-time feedback loop. It’s about iterating quickly and improving with every campaign. Here’s how:  Ok, I know. Loop Marketing puts a lot in AI’s robotic hands, but that doesn’t mean you can just sit back and watch it do the work. Successful Loop Marketing needs clear role definition and collaboration between humans and AI systems. In Loop Marketing, humans own the strategic elements — taste, brand judgment, relationship building, and creative direction. AI accelerates the operational aspects — data analysis, content generation, personalization at scale, and campaign orchestration. Human responsibilities include: AI handles: To maintain this balance, make sure to establish team guardrails, including comprehensive prompt libraries, detailed brand kits that guide AI decision-making, clear review workflows with human approval checkpoints, and robust data privacy policies. AI can certainly help us with quantity, but that doesn’t mean we start neglecting quality. Make sure your team keeps a high standard where AI recommendations require human approval before implementation, ensuring that technology enhances rather than replaces human judgment.

Still, rather than pick dozens to piece together, HubSpot can give you a single integrated platform that provides the ideal foundation for implementing the Loop. Here's what that would look like: Begin by integrating brand voice in Content Hub to create a style guide and leverage Breeze to maintain consistency across all content creation.  Source You can create content templates and approval workflows that ensure brand alignment while enabling rapid production. Marketing Studio can help you turn a campaign brief into a mix of content assets across multiple channels and formats. The Tailor stage includes some features of HubSpot I’ve loved for years. At prior organizations, I’d craft “smart lists,” draft automated emails, and use personalization tokens almost on the daily. Today, they’ve just gotten more advanced. Create Smart CRM segments that automatically update based on behavioral triggers.  Source Implement the Personalization Agent to deliver individualized experiences (not just [first name]), and deploy AI-powered email sequences that adapt messaging based on engagement patterns and preferences. Trying new mediums and platforms can be intimidating but doing this in the Amplify stage of Loop Marketing is easy. Marketing Studio can help you plan, create, and launch multi-channel campaigns, and Customer Agent lets you set up live chat and chatbots on your website to personalize interactions at scale.  You can also use Content Hub's repurposing capabilities to maximize your content across multiple platforms and use AEO grader to identify and implement AI Engine Optimization (AEO) strategies to improve discoverability in AI-powered search results. Every loop is a marketing lesson. Evolve is for gathering those insights and lessons to be used in your next campaign. In HubSpot, this may mean deploying Marketing Analytics to measure, track, and report on all your marketing activities. You can also implement journey analysis to understand cross-channel attribution and establish regular testing cadences that feed insights back into the loop for continuous improvement.  Source But measurement isn’t limited to just this stage. Every stage of Loop Marketing has metrics that can help you analyze and improve your performance. Effective Loop Marketing measurement focuses on quality signals, engagement velocity, and pipeline impact rather than vanity metrics. Analytics can answer questions about your Loop Marketing strategy that other things cannot. Here’s what that looks like in each stage. During the Express stage, your focus is on how quickly you’re producing on-brand, high-quality marketing content. You want to evaluate how quickly you create on-brand content and effectively leverage existing assets (i.e., repurposing content). Key metrics include: Here, the focus is engagement. You’re personalizing your content and experiences, so you want to know how your target audience is responding to it. Key metrics include: What channels are working? That’s what you need to be paying attention to during the Amplify stage. Track conversion rates by channel, AI engine visibility through citations and mentions, and influence generated through creator and community partnerships. Maintain detailed attribution notes to understand which touchpoints assist conversions rather than just final-click attribution. Key metrics include: How well are you experimenting and iterating? Focus on testing frequency, insight implementation rates, and cycle improvement velocity. Key metrics include:  Loop Marketing is new, so it may be unfair to say these mistakes are “common.” However, they are traps I wouldn’t be surprised if marketers fell into, even with the best intentions. Understanding these pitfalls can save significant time, resources, and frustration while accelerating your path to success. The problem: Many teams attempt to launch comprehensive Loop Marketing at all stages simultaneously, leading to overwhelming complexity and diluted focus. The reality: Research shows that only 26% of companies have developed the necessary capabilities to move beyond proofs of concept and generate tangible value from AI at this time. How to avoid: Start with the stage where you see the most issues and can achieve quick wins. If content creation is your sore spot, begin with Express. If you have content but poor engagement, start with Tailor. Master one stage before expanding to others, allowing your team to build confidence and expertise incrementally. The problem: Teams implement AI-powered automation but skip the crucial “human-in-the-loop” approval processes, leading to brand voice inconsistencies or inappropriate content. The reality: According to McKinsey, only 27% of people whose organizations use generative AI say that employees review all content created by AI before it is used, while successful organizations maintain stronger human oversight. How to avoid: Establish clear review workflows where AI accelerates creation but humans guide and approve final outputs. Create comprehensive brand guidelines and prompt libraries that guide AI behavior and never deploy AI-generated content without human review, especially in customer-facing communications. Loop Marketing is a new way to grow — powered by humans and AI, working together to express your message, tailor it to your audience, amplify it across channels, and evolve it in real time. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. The problem: Organizations track impressive-sounding metrics like content volume or email open rates without connecting these activities to actual business outcomes and revenue growth. The reality: HubSpot Research found that customer satisfaction (CSAT) and retention are the two most important customer experience metrics (both at 31%), followed by response time (29%). This emphasizes the importance of outcomes over superficial engagement. How to avoid: For each loop stage, establish both leading indicators (activities) and lagging indicators (outcomes). Track how “Express” activities lead to better “Tailor” performance, how “Tailor” improvements drive “Amplify” results, and how the entire loop impacts customer lifetime value and revenue growth. Use attribution modeling to connect loop activities to business results. The problem: In the rush to personalize experiences, teams collect and use customer data without proper consent frameworks or privacy protections, risking compliance violations and customer trust. The reality: 40.44% of marketers cite data privacy concerns as the most significant barrier to AI adoption, while 83% of consumers are willing to share their data to create a more personalized experience when handled transparently. Consumers want personalization, but only if brands are open about how they make it happen. How to avoid: Implement privacy-by-design principles from the start. Clearly communicate what data you're collecting and how it benefits the customer. Provide easy opt-out mechanisms and respect customer preferences. Remember that 71% of consumers expect personalized communications, but they want control over the process. The problem: Teams optimize individual channels without ensuring consistency and continuity across the customer journey, creating fragmented experiences that confuse and frustrate customers. The reality: 86% of customers want conversations with agents to move seamlessly from one channel to another without repeating information, yet many organizations fail to achieve this experience. How to avoid: Map the complete customer journey across all touchpoints before optimizing individual channels. Ensure data flows seamlessly between channels so customers don't repeat information. Use unified customer profiles that update in real-time across all systems, and test the customer experience end-to-end, not just individual channel performance. The problem: Organizations implement Loop Marketing technology without adequately preparing their teams for new workflows and AI technology, which leads to resistance, poor adoption, and suboptimal results. The reality: 39% of marketers don't know how to use generative AI safely yet, and 43% say they don't know how to get the most value out of it. In other words, a lot of marketers aren’t confident in using AI yet. How to avoid: 54% of marketers believe generative AI training programs are important for success. (That includes me.) That said, invest in comprehensive training programs before launching Loop Marketing initiatives. Create internal champions who can guide others through the transition. Establish clear guidelines for AI use, provide ongoing support, and celebrate early wins to build momentum. Remember that successful Loop Marketing requires both technological capability and human expertise working together. The problem: Teams execute marketing activities but fail to systematically capture, analyze, and apply insights back into the loop, missing the core advantage of the loop approach. The reality: 25.6% of marketers report that AI-generated content is more successful than content created without AI, but only when organizations consistently measure, learn, and optimize based on results. How to avoid: Build systematic feedback collection into every stage of your loop. Schedule regular review cycles where teams analyze performance data and identify optimization opportunities. Create processes for rapid testing and implementing improvements and ensure insights from one loop cycle inform the strategy for the next cycle. The Evolve stage isn‘t optional — it’s what makes Loop Marketing superior to static campaign approaches. Again, at the moment these pitfalls are hypothetical, but by being aware of them and implementing the suggestions proactively, organizations can accelerate their Loop Marketing success while building sustainable, scalable growth systems that improve over time. Closed-loop marketing refers to measurement practices (closed-loop reporting) that connect marketing activities to revenue outcomes — essentially closing the attribution loop between spend and results. Loop Marketing, by contrast, is the overarching strategic framework that emphasizes continuous learning and adaptation across all marketing activities. Closed-loop reporting fits within Loop Marketing as the measurement layer, but the Loop encompasses the entire approach to campaign creation, execution, and optimization. Small teams should focus on one stage initially rather than attempting to implement the entire loop simultaneously. Start with either the Express stage by creating a comprehensive style guide and content templates, or the Tailor stage by identifying one high-impact personalization use case. Express is ideal if content creation is a bottleneck, since establishing brand guidelines and AI-assisted content creation can immediately increase output. Tailor is better if you have content but struggle with relevance, as implementing smart segmentation and personalization can significantly improve engagement rates. Expand to additional stages as team capacity grows and initial implementations prove successful. Loop Marketing momentum increases with each complete cycle, making it important to focus on establishing the cadence rather than expecting immediate, dramatic results. Initial improvements typically appear within 4-6 weeks as content creation accelerates, and personalization begins impacting engagement. More significant results emerge after 2-3 complete cycles (approximately 3-6 months) as the system accumulates learnings and optimization compounds. The key is maintaining consistent loop practices and celebrating small wins that build toward larger improvements. Each stage requires both leading and lagging indicators that provide actionable insights. Focus on clarity and actionability rather than tracking numerous metrics that don't drive decisions. Loop Marketing principles are platform-agnostic and can be implemented using various marketing technology combinations. However, HubSpot's unified Smart CRM and Breeze AI capabilities make orchestration significantly faster and easier. The key requirements are unified data, AI-powered automation, and integrated analytics. While these can be assembled from multiple vendors, HubSpot provides them in a single platform designed specifically for this integrated approach, reducing implementation complexity and improving data consistency across all loop stages. Listen, Loop Marketing isn‘t about abandoning everything you know; it’s about finally having a framework that keeps pace with how people actually discover, research, and buy today. The beauty is that you don‘t need to tear your existing workflow apart. Pick your weakest link — whether that’s churning out content, personalizing at scale, or actually learning from your campaigns — and start there. Master one stage, let AI handle the heavy lifting, and watch as each cycle gets sharper, faster, and more effective than the last. Grab HubSpot (or your platform of choice), get your humans and AI on the same page, and start looping.

CultureCon's Shareese Bembury-Coakley has a question that will completely reframe your unique value prop Updated: 
  
    
  
  
  
    10/08/25
  

  It’s a marketer’s dream: Hosting a sold-out event for 10k attendees. That brands are begging to be a part of. Oh, and that was headlined this year by none other than Taraji P. Henson, Kerry Washington, and Jennifer Hudson.  That’s Shareese Bembury-Coakley’s reality as one of the driving forces behind CultureCon, the world’s largest festival for Black creatives and entrepreneurs. Here’s how she makes the magic happen.  Claim to fame: Successfully sold a partnership between the TV show Killing Eve and buy-now-pay-later service Klarna; deliverables included an in-app experience that sourced pieces from Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh’s (truly incredible) wardrobes. (Lesson 0: Look for audience behavior that you can amplify. Bembury-Coakley had noted that viewers were asking questions on social media about designers.) At CultureCon, Bembury-Coakley tells me, people make a run for Activation Alley as soon as it opens. It’s not just that the activations are amazing or that a particular brand is there — it’s that CultureCon’s attendees have high expectations, because they trust that this year’s activations will be as good as the last. (More on this in a minute.) With events and experiential spaces becoming ever more saturated, I ask Bembury-Coakley how she stands out in a crowd. Her answer is deceptively simple: Instead of answering the question, “Why do this idea?” answer the question, “Why do this idea with me?” “It’s not just about it being a unique idea,” she says. “Oftentimes, people can’t answer the ‘with me’ question.” To answer it, evaluate your cultural relevancy, your community, and your consistency. And think of it as a lens. When you focus your ideas through “why me,” you can frame your deliverables in a way that makes it “as easy as possible to get buy-in.” Trust was a through-line in our conversation, both interpersonally and between brands and audience. Bembury-Coakley credits much of her success to having had amazing advocates throughout her career — but ""it‘s double-sided,” she says. “It comes with the very heavy responsibility of making sure that you’re also fulfilling your promises on the back end.” In other words: Trust is not something that Shareese Bembury-Coakley takes lightly. She carries this responsibility into her work with brands and partnerships. I ask her what makes her say “no” to a CultureCon partnership, and she immediately says, “anything that would betray the trust we’ve built with our community.” Trust is the underlying reason that Activation Alley is so popular — brand activations “aren’t a necessary evil that you’re connecting with for a free water bottle,” Bembury-Coakley says. They’re “a testament to how authentically our partners have showed up in the past.”  The secret behind the Activation Alley hype is pretty simple, really: Consistency. “Creators should always remember that their point of contact has a boss,” Bembury-Coakley says. “Usually the person they‘re talking to is a stakeholder — but it’s generally not the key stakeholder.” “Anything that you can do to be a resource to make it easier on your partner is going to increase the likelihood of them working with you again,” she says. “I think sometimes you look at the brands as a whole, but they are [made up of] individuals.” It’s easy for creators to forget that “figuring how to navigate these brands internally in a way that makes it easy on them” — and that makes them more likely to want to keep working with you. And on the flip side, “the brand should always remember why they wanted to work with that creator to begin with.” What often happens, she says, is that a creator’s content might be slightly controversial, but once they’ve signed with a brand, the brand “wants them to be extremely brand-safe in a way that would be betraying their audience.” See? It all comes down to trust. Masters in Marketing was a proud sponsor of this year’s CultureCon, which took place October 4 - 5, 2025. When it comes to building partnerships for CultureCon, how do you decide which people to collaborate with — whether that’s speakers, creators, or community leaders — to make sure they authentically represent CultureCon’s mission and resonate with your audience? —Deesha Laxsav, Senior manager of brand marketing, Clutch Bembury-Coakley: At CultureCon, data is paramount to everything we do. So, we‘re not making assumptions about our audience, we’re not just coming up with ideas. We're really letting that [data] inform everything that you see. So, the programming that you see being hyper-relevant? Our communities told us what they wanted, the brands that they like to engage with, the speakers they wanted to hear from, and we listened to them. I think a lot of brands and communities are sometimes trying to go against the grain, trying to push something on their audience, and it‘s not what they want. We evolve and iterate [based on data], and that’s why the brands and the community and the speakers can come out and have a great time. Bembury-Coakley asks: I think nostalgia is something that‘s been overdone. I would love to know: What’s a better way for brands to engage with communities or consumers that they want to connect with?

How to execute and measure successful email marketing campaigns Updated:

  Email marketing analytics have evolved far beyond open rates and click-throughs. Today’s AI-powered analytics can predict which subscribers are most likely to convert, optimize send times for maximum engagement, and track every dollar of revenue back to specific campaigns.  The difference between good and great email marketing often comes down to which metrics you track (and, more importantly, how you act on them). AI email marketing analytics transforms raw data into actionable insights, helping you understand what happened, why it happened, and what’s likely to happen next. Tools like HubSpot Marketing Hub have made this sophisticated analysis accessible through native dashboards and reporting features that automatically surface patterns human analysts might miss. Whether analyzing predictive engagement scores or tracking complex revenue attribution paths, these AI-driven insights help you make smarter decisions faster. In this guide, I’ll explore five essential AI-powered metrics directly impacting your bottom line. Plus, you’ll learn what AI email marketing analytics tools to use and, most importantly, how to use these insights to create email campaigns that consistently drive revenue growth.

No one really trusted the data they were looking at.” With Twilio Segment, Camping World’s paid media efforts saw a 35% increase in conversions. They also saw a 16% decrease in cost-per-lead due to cleaner and properly implemented data collection, thus allowing Camping World’s ads to perform better. Greene added, “With Twilio Segment, we have a full view of the customer, from the first time they hit our site to post-purchase and on.” In this section, I’ll walk you through the most valuable AI email marketing metrics to track, including: Each of these metrics transforms raw email data into actionable insights that directly impact revenue, starting with the most fundamental: understanding which subscribers are actually ready to engage with your content (aka predictive engagement scoring). Predictive engagement scoring is an AI-powered system that analyzes multiple data inputs to calculate the likelihood of individual subscribers taking specific actions in response to your emails. Unlike traditional engagement metrics that report past behavior, predictive scoring utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast future actions. It assigns numerical scores (typically 0-100) that indicate each contact’s likelihood of opening, clicking, or converting from upcoming campaigns. Use the following data inputs to power your predictive engagement scoring: Once you have predictive engagement scores, use them to optimize content distribution and timing automatically. These decision rules transform scores into actionable marketing strategies that improve performance while protecting the sender’s reputation. Here’s how to prioritize each segment: A predictive engagement score is like a credit score for your email subscribers — it predicts how likely each person is to open, click, or buy from your next email. Behind the scenes, AI analyzes data points about each subscriber, transforms them into meaningful patterns, and outputs a simple 0-100 score that marketers can actually use. While the math happens automatically, understanding the basics helps you trust the predictions and recognize which subscriber behaviors are most important. Here’s how you’ll set up your data infrastructure to ensure that AI calculates engagement scores correctly: How to execute and measure successful email marketing campaigns All fields are required.

Content performance scoring uses AI to evaluate and predict the effectiveness of email subject lines, body copy, and templates by analyzing multiple quality signals and comparing them against historical performance data. This scoring system assigns numerical values (typically 0-100) to email content based on semantic similarity to high-performing messages, readability metrics, brand voice consistency, and predicted engagement uplift. To get a better understanding of each scoring factor, take a look at the list below: Content relevance and attribution uplift tell you exactly how much improvement each content change delivers. Without proper testing, you can’t know if better results came from your content changes or from external factors like seasonality, news events, or random chance. Just think of these controlled experiments like testing a new recipe: you need to keep all ingredients the same, except for one, to know which change made it taste better. To measure genuine improvement, you need clean comparisons that isolate the impact of your content changes. Use the following step-by-step system to run clean tests: Content insights in Content Hub automatically track these test results and calculate statistical significance, showing you which content variations drive meaningful uplift without requiring manual analysis of the data. Pro tip: Be sure to exclude new subscribers (less than 30 days) who could exhibit unpredictable behavior. Send Time Optimization (STO) accuracy measures how effectively AI-predicted delivery times outperform standard scheduling by comparing engagement metrics between optimized and baseline send times. STO calibration is the process of fine-tuning these predictions to account for audience-specific patterns, ensuring the AI model’s recommendations align with actual subscriber behavior rather than generic best practices. To ensure STO accuracy, here’s what you’ll want to do (in three simple steps): Pro tip: Document your results in a simple spreadsheet, including: After 10 campaigns, you’ll clearly see whether STO works for your specific audience. Before trusting AI to determine when your emails are sent, use this validation checklist to confirm the system improves performance without overwhelming subscribers. This three-step process ensures statistically valid results while protecting your sender reputation: Deliverability analytics measure whether your emails reach subscribers’ inboxes versus spam folders or get blocked entirely. These metrics utilize AI to predict delivery issues before they impact your sender reputation, helping maintain a 95%+ inbox placement rate (IPR) required for successful email marketing. Tracking inbox placement trends involves monitoring where your emails land over time to identify delivery issues before they escalate. By monitoring daily placement rates and comparing them to your baseline, you can identify issues 5 to 7 days before they significantly impact your email program, allowing you to adjust your strategy and protect your sender reputation. To track inbox placement trends, complete the following steps: Once your emails consistently reach inboxes, the next challenge is proving their business impact. While deliverability ensures your messages arrive, you need sophisticated attribution models to connect those delivered emails to actual revenue and understand how they influence the entire customer lifecycle. Email attribution connects every email interaction — opens, clicks, replies — to specific business outcomes by tracking how these actions influence deals throughout the sales cycle. When someone opens your product announcement email, clicks the demo link, and eventually becomes a customer three weeks later, attribution mapping traces this journey by linking the email event to their contact record, then to their sales opportunity, and finally to the closed deal. This unified Smart CRM attribution ensures that marketing receives credit for revenue influence, while sales teams see which campaigns warmed up their prospects. Understanding exactly how this attribution flows through your CRM requires breaking down each layer of the tracking process, from initial engagement to final revenue calculation. In the following section, I'll walk you through how modern AI-powered platforms transform scattered email interactions into a clear revenue story. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of how the email attribution and lifecycle work: Modern platforms (like HubSpot) automatically map this entire journey. Then, AI technology (such as Breeze AI) analyzes patterns across thousands of these journeys to identify which email sequences, subject lines, and content types most effectively move contacts through each stage. This visibility transforms email from a “spray and pray” channel into a predictable revenue driver where you can forecast that every 1,000 emails to engaged contacts generates approximately $25,000 in influenced revenue within 90 days.

The most effective AI email analytics dashboards follow a three-tier structure that progresses from high-level business metrics to predictive insights to operational health indicators. Ultimately, your dashboard should tell a story at a glance: HubSpot Marketing Hub’s customizable dashboards enable this exact layout, with drag-and-drop widgets that automatically update as your AI models process new data, ensuring teams always see the most current insights without manual reporting work. A well-designed AI email analytics dashboard follows a strategic visual hierarchy that guides your team from high-level business outcomes down to operational alerts, ensuring critical information gets noticed first. The following structure mirrors how marketing leaders actually consume data: TDLR — Your dashboard should refresh hourly for alerts, daily for KPIs, and weekly for predictive insights, balancing real-time awareness with meaningful trend analysis. Modern marketing teams should prioritize five AI email metrics that directly impact revenue: HubSpot Marketing Hub provides native dashboards for tracking these AI email analytics metrics in real-time, while Breeze AI enables predictive scoring that identifies high-value subscribers before they convert. Validate AI predictions by running control tests that compare AI-recommended actions against your baseline performance. Track prediction accuracy rates by measuring whether subscribers identified as “highly engaged” by AI actually open, click, and convert at predicted rates. That said, I recommend aiming for an accuracy rate of 75% or higher. HubSpot Marketing Hub enables A/B testing between AI-optimized campaigns and traditional segments, automatically calculating statistical significance. Document performance over 30 to 60-day periods to identify seasonal variations and model drift. AI email marketing analytics tools should provide confidence scores for each prediction to ensure accuracy. AI-powered revenue attribution connects email touchpoints to closed deals through multi-touch attribution models that track the complete customer journey. Configure your AI email analytics to track first-touch, last-touch, and weighted attribution across all email interactions, assigning revenue credit based on engagement patterns and proximity to conversion. HubSpot Marketing Hub’s revenue attribution reporting automatically calculates email ROI by connecting campaign engagement to CRM deal data. At the same time, HubSpot’s Breeze Intelligence identifies which email sequences drive the highest customer lifetime value. Track metrics like: Get a demo of Breeze to see how predictive analytics can forecast the impact of email revenue before the campaigns launch. Benchmark AI email metrics against three standards: Then, track improvement rates monthly. Compare your predictive engagement accuracy (should exceed 70%), send time optimization lift (target 15-25% improvement), and revenue attribution coverage (aim for 80%+ of conversions tracked). Marketing Hub provides industry benchmark data within its reporting dashboards, comparing your AI metric performance against similar-sized companies in your sector. Document performance gaps and set quarterly improvement targets for each AI metric. Present AI email analytics to leadership by focusing on revenue impact, efficiency gains, and predictive insights rather than technical metrics. Create executive dashboards showing three key storylines: HubSpot Marketing Hub enables custom executive dashboards that visualize AI email marketing analytics alongside business KPIs, while Breeze provides predictive forecasts for upcoming quarter performance. Structure presentations with before-and-after comparisons, showcasing specific examples of AI predictions that prevent churn or identify hidden opportunities. Additionally, confidence intervals and risk assessments should be included to build trust in AI recommendations. See this dashboard in HubSpot for executive-ready AI analytics templates that translate complex metrics into business outcomes. AI email marketing analytics has evolved from a nice-to-have into a critical driver of marketing success. The five metrics we’ve explored — predictive engagement scoring, content intelligence analytics, send time optimization, deliverability monitoring, and revenue attribution — work together to create a complete picture of your email program’s health and potential. As you implement these metrics, remember that implementing AI email analytics isn’t just a work in progress; it’s a process. Start with one or two metrics that address your biggest challenges — whether that’s improving engagement, fixing deliverability issues, or proving revenue impact. Build confidence in the predictions, establish baseline performance, and gradually expand to the full suite of AI-powered insights.

  AI usage is on the rise, especially in marketing. Data from HubSpot’s AI Trends in Marketing report showed that 74% of marketing professionals use AI for their work. With so many marketers using AI, it is important to acknowledge and solve for its known limitations, particularly the biases that are baked into it.  As an inclusive marketing strategist and consultant, I am trained to recognize bias when I encounter it. Whenever I review materials and campaigns for clients, I evaluate whether bias, cultural insensitivity, or inappropriate messages have crept into the communications. But, most of the marketers I’ve come across either don’t yet have this skillset or are actively working on developing it. Many often don’t pick up on biases AI produces, which could prove detrimental to marketing efforts and brand reputation if published in the market. To help you use AI more responsibly and effectively, I’ve created some prompts to help you cut out bias. Let’s dive in. New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Before we get into actual prompts, it's useful to ensure you are grounded in the fundamental question consumers (especially those from underrepresented and underserved communities) are asking. As consumers evaluate whether or not your brand is right for them, they are seeking to answer this question, either consciously or subconsciously: Is this product for someone like me? Every part of your customer journey serves as an input to producing an answer to this question. So, if any aspect of your customer journey features bias, you’re signaling to potential buyers that “this product isn’t for someone like you.” In most instances, that signal isn’t one the brand intends to send. Now, let’s focus on how you can use AI to let your audience know that “this is for you.” Joyann Boyce is an inclusive AI expert and founder of Inclued AI, a tool that helps marketers with inclusive communication. She told me that it is helpful to think of AI as a very well-trained puppy. She explains, “It’s like someone has already house-trained the puppy. And, they’re going to give it to you, and you’re going to customize it to your home.” Customizing your well-trained AI puppy means training it to ensure it communicates with your customers in a way that draws them closer to you, rather than pushing them away because of any bias. Have a listen to the full conversation with Joyann Boyce on this episode of the Inclusion & Marketing podcast. 00:00/00:00 While AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in their training data, they can also serve as powerful tools for detecting and mitigating bias in human decision-making processes. By leveraging AI's ability to analyze patterns and flag potential inconsistencies, you can create more objective evaluation frameworks and uncover blind spots that might otherwise go unnoticed. Start by providing your AI tool with clear context about its role and perspective. Specify exactly what persona or expert viewpoint the AI should adopt, and define the particular lens through which it should analyze your content when giving feedback. Right from the beginning, I like to tell my AI collaborators that it is a highly skilled, inclusive marketing strategist. That works from a general standpoint for reviewing content on the whole and for broader audiences. However, if you want to be even more specific about the type of feedback you are looking for, tweak the context for that point of expertise. Let’s say you want to understand whether an ad has bias toward consumers over the age of 50. You can prompt your AI companion to review the content through the lens of a marketing expert who has expertise in that consumer base. As an example, I asked AI to review a web page about anti-aging products. I asked it to act like a marketer who specializes in reaching consumers over 50. The AI could then use that foundation to give me helpful feedback.  Here is the first part of the feedback it produced about language that was ageist and lacked inclusivity:  Here are the recommendations AI gave for how to improve the copy to make it more inclusive:  The goal is to prevent publishing content that already has bias in it. However, there will be times when you’ll need to reevaluate and improve on something that is already in the market. So, here is a prompt to help you when creating new content, and one to help you improve what has already been produced. You are an inclusive marketing strategist who specializes in marketing to consumers over the age of 50. Please review these headlines, and let me know if there is anything I should be aware of that would rub consumers who are interested in the product the wrong way. I’m particularly interested in anything that would be offensive, culturally inappropriate, or just not inclusive. You are a copywriter who specializes in marketing to consumers over the age of 50. Please brainstorm 10 headlines for this skin care web page that deliver on our product goals while making our ideal customers, including people over the age of 50, feel seen, supported, and like they belong with our brand. One of the challenges that many marketing communications face when it comes to being inclusive is that the brand hasn’t effectively defined its ideal customer. For instance, a brand might say they are targeting “women aged 25-34 who are looking to advance their careers.” However, even though there is specificity about age, gender, and even aspirations, there is still so much context missing that could influence the way the consumer receives messages you create from them. As such, when working with AI, avoid treating it like it is talking to a general market audience. Instead, provide your AI companion with additional details about who you want to communicate with. This will help it better tailor its messages to the audience you are targeting. So, instead of saying you’re creating landing page copy for “women aged 25-34 who are looking to advance their careers,” add in details about their identities. That additional information will support your AI companion in crafting messages that have less bias. Some of the identity-based details about your ideal customer to include in your prompt could be: As such, a prompt to draft copy for a landing page could look like this: The audience for this landing page includes women 25-34 who want to advance their careers. This includes Black, Latina, and Asian women. Some are married. Some have young children at home. All have at least a Bachelor’s degree, and they live in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Mexico, and 30% of them are neurodivergent. Most of them don’t yet own a home. Please draft a landing page for them that takes their identities and needs in mind. Please identify anything in the copy of this landing page that would prevent people with [insert identities] from feeling seen, supported, and like they belong. Your target consumers have many identities, and you want to make sure each person feels connected to you’re offering. That means creating inclusive campaigns that avoid bias, and AI tools can help you get it right. You just need to tell your tools what type of content you don’t want to include in your messaging. When I’m doing an audit for clients’ brands from an inclusion standpoint, some of the things I’m looking for include: Being this specific is especially important. If your AI tool is just focused on one area, you may miss out on other areas that are problematic. In this example, I asked AI to evaluate a blog post for cultural bias. It missed some problem areas I would have flagged. When I asked it why it didn’t pick up on those problems, here is what it had to say:  Based on the specific type of communication you are having AI help you write, be sure to include specific instructions on elements you want to include or want to avoid. Please create some images we can use for this social media ad that are reflective of our ideal customers. Ensure adequate representation of the different identities of the consumers we serve that is free of common stereotypes and cultural biases. In this ad, please highlight any areas that would be considered problematic from an inclusion perspective. Take into account inclusive language (ex., Are there any AAVE included?). Are there stereotypes associated with any of the images we are highlighting? When your AI-generated content authentically reflects your brand values and speaks meaningfully to diverse audiences, it builds trust and connection with potential customers who might otherwise feel overlooked or misunderstood. This inclusive approach not only helps you avoid alienating prospects due to unconscious bias but also demonstrates your commitment to serving all customers equitably. That can significantly differentiate your brand in today's marketplace, where consumers increasingly expect businesses to be socially conscious and representative. Re-training your AI tools to catch bias can help you connect with a larger audience. The sooner you make the switch, the faster you can grow.

List all your current CRM processes — how leads come in, how sales follow up, and what happens after someone becomes a customer. Don't overthink it; just write down what actually happens day-to-day. HubSpot works differently from most legacy CRMs. It's all about workflows that trigger automatically when certain things happen (like when someone fills out a form or opens an email). Take some time to play around in HubSpot and see how workflows function. For each process you currently have, figure out how to recreate it in HubSpot. The good news? You don't have to copy everything exactly - this is your chance to fix those annoying parts of your old system that never worked quite right. Don't try to rebuild everything at once. Pick your most important process (usually lead follow-up) and get that working perfectly before moving on to the next one. Before you go live, run your workflows with a few test contacts to ensure they work like you expect. Trust me, it's much easier to fix issues before your whole team is using it. Once it's running, check your workflow reports regularly. HubSpot shows you exactly where people are getting stuck, so you can keep improving. The biggest mindset shift? Think of HubSpot as your new automated assistant that never forgets to follow up, rather than just a place to store contact info. Your marketing automation not working after switching CRMs could likely be due to one or more factors. Your data got messy in the move. Names of contact properties might have changed, or some of your data didn‘t transfer properly. Check if your automation is trying to use fields that don’t exist anymore or have different formatting. For example, if your old system called it “Lead Source” and HubSpot calls it “Original Source,” your workflows won't know what to look for. Integrations broke. Your marketing automation likely relied on connections between your old CRM and tools such as the email platform or landing page builder, whose connections need to be rebuilt with your new system. Different trigger logic. Your old automation might have triggered when “Lead Status = Hot” but now you need it to activate when “Lifecycle Stage = Marketing Qualified Lead.” Your workflow automation logic is the same, but the language is different. Permissions and settings. Sometimes, automation gets turned off during migration, user permissions are changed, or email-sending domains need to be re-verified. Quick troubleshooting steps: You can keep most of your workflow automation processes after switching CRMS, but bear in mind that switching CRMs provides an excellent chance to improve your processes. Ask yourself: “Is our automation working well, or are we just used to the process?” Many businesses find that their new CRM works better when simplifying overly complex workflows. Your data will transfer, but it might look different. Historical reports may need rebuilding, and some data relationships might change. Always export everything from your old system before starting, and keep that old system accessible for at least 6 months as a backup.

  If there’s one thing I’ve learned in years as a marketer, it’s that understanding the key distinctions of content marketing versus inbound marketing can transform how you attract and convert customers.  The two strategies are like the Baldwin brothers — closely related but dramatically different, so employing the wrong one could mean the difference between a blockbuster and a bust. (I mean, imagine Alec in Biodome; it just wouldn’t work.) Today, content marketing and inbound marketing actually work together, with content serving as the fuel that powers your inbound engine. But knowing exactly how they compare and work with AI will help you build a more effective marketing strategy. Let’s unpack all the details. Table of Contents HubSpot's Annual Inbound Marketing Trends Report All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. TLDR: Content marketing is a core part of inbound marketing, but not all inbound marketing is content. Content marketing focuses on creating a variety of valuable, relevant content (e.g., blog articles, guides, videos) to attract and engage potential buyers. Inbound marketing is a broader methodology that uses content, SEO, email, social media, lead nurturing, and automation to attract, convert, and delight customers throughout their journey. The strategies work best together. Content drives awareness, while inbound turns that attention into leads and customers. For the best results, use content marketing as the catalyst for your inbound strategy, supported by the right tools and data. HubSpot has all of the tools you need to implement the two strategies, and you can get started for free. When I tell people I work in content marketing, they assume I’m making videos on TikTok or posting on Instagram all day, but that’s a bit misguided. Yes, content marketing can include social media, but that’s not all it is. Content marketing is when a business or brand creates, packages, and distributes valuable information to attract and engage their target audience — ultimately leading to a purchase. Instead of directly pitching products, it provides genuinely useful information that solves their audience's problems, answers their questions, or even just brightens their day. It can be written, visual, auditory, or interactive. The catch? Regardless of medium, your content must deliver value, whether or not someone ever becomes a customer. It's about building trust and authority first, sales second. For example, a project management software company might publish guides on remote team collaboration, not just features of their tool. At the same time, a meal delivery service like Hello Fresh may share recipes and healthy eating tips.  Source In both instances, the companies solve their audience's challenges and demonstrate expertise, but don’t go for the hard sell of their product. Types of content marketing can include:  Source Content marketing isn’t just more fun for your audience; it also has a number of benefits for your business. By taking advantage of public platforms like blogs and social media, most content marketing is low- or no-cost to get started with. On top of lower upfront costs, content marketing tends to generate compounding returns, so it’s especially attractive to businesses with a tighter budget. Read: How to Manage Your Entire Marketing Budget [Free Budget Planner Templates] Producing consistent content (especially blog posts, articles, etc.) creates more pages for your brand and website to get found through search engines and even AI agents like ChatGPT or Gemini. They also create more opportunities to get shared.  Pro tip: Our free AEO Grader can help you find these opps.  Greater visibility comes with greater brand awareness, which is the first step in getting someone to buy from you. Even more importantly, however, sharing helpful, informative content helps companies build credibility and trust with their audience as an expert. Read: How to Build a Brand Awareness Strategy (and Why It Matters) With its low costs and longer-term impact, content marketing delivers a strong return on investment. In fact, according to Neal Schaffer, content marketing is 62% less expensive than traditional marketing, yet generates three times as many leads.

I know you’re probably thinking, “Content sounds a lot like inbound marketing, Ramona.” And you’re right. But content marketing is just one piece of the inbound puzzle. Inbound marketing is a comprehensive methodology that attracts customers through relevant, helpful content and experiences tailored to them. While old-school marketing tactics (like billboards) interrupt audiences, inbound marketing aims to deliver the information people need when they are actively seeking it. Inbound marketing includes: It's a full-funnel approach: attract strangers, convert visitors to leads, close leads into customers, and delight customers into promoters. Content marketing brilliantly handles the “attract” phase, no doubt, but inbound marketing orchestrates the entire journey.  Source In addition to the low cost and high ROI benefits of content marketing, inbound marketing offers a few unique big-picture benefits. Inbound marketing doesn’t stop at just awareness; it outlines a path from attraction to engagement (conversion and purchase) to delight. In other words, its goal is to engage customers at every stage of their journey and actually close a purchase. It can accomplish this using lead capture and conversion rate optimization, lead nurturing, automation, chatbots, sales enablement, and more. Part of the fun of incorporating so many different tactics in inbound is that each buyer's journey can be distinct. With such a variety of channels and touchpoints, buyers can feel like their experience is catered specifically to them. One person may find you through a blog article, peruse your website, and then decide to buy in a few hours. Another may see a paid ad, ignore it, but then follow you on social media and make a purchase a year later. Plus, thanks to automation and AI, you can use behaviors, segmentation, etc., to serve prospects different messages, calls-to-action, or even website pages. Every journey is a snowflake. Because inbound focuses on pulling in people who are already interested, the leads tend to be more qualified. This increases conversion rates compared to more generalized content distribution. Inbound marketing emphasizes “delighting” customers after converting through thoughtful onboarding, support content, and personalized communication. These efforts help new customers start on the right foot, which can improve their overall experience and customer lifetime value, drive referrals, and reduce churn. While content marketing mostly focuses on building trust and awareness, inbound marketing tries to build ongoing loyalty. Inbound tends to involve more digital tools and infrastructure: marketing automation, lead scoring, CRM integration, email workflows, landing pages, etc. This means marketers have more opportunities to measure which touchpoints are working, optimize the funnel, and align with sales more tightly. So what are the actual differences between content marketing and inbound marketing? In short, content marketing is a tactic, while inbound is a holistic methodology. Content marketing tends to be more awareness-focused, while inbound tackles the whole customer journey through conversion, purchase, and delight. Truth is, you can do content marketing without a full inbound strategy (like publishing a blog without lead capture forms). But you can‘t do inbound marketing without content. It’s the fuel that attracts people in the first place. Loop marketing is an evolution of inbound marketing. Like inbound, Loop marketing employs multiple channels and moves through the full buyer’s journey, but it now takes into account the impact of AI in the modern ecosystem and how its fast pace requires constant optimization. If you're just getting started with your marketing strategy (i.e, creating customer personas, your content strategy, etc.), begin with inbound marketing principles. If you have all this and ready to level-up your results with AI-powered personalization, cross-channel amplification, and rapid optimization, loop in Loop Marketing. Get 100+ FREE expert AI prompts for each stage of the Loop Marketing playbook. Like all great marketing questions, the answer to this one is “it depends.” Which approach delivers better ROI really depends on your business’s goals and how you specifically use content or inbound. For example, if you’re simply using content to build a following on social media, perhaps content alone will give you the return you’re looking for. However, if you’re trying to convert leads and make sales, you likely see more return from your inbound efforts. HubSpot's Annual Inbound Marketing Trends Report All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Marketing has massively shifted since the early days of content marketing and inbound marketing. Personally, I’d go as far as to say the modifiers of “content” and “inbound” are obsolete, as their tactics have just become general marketing best practice — but the shift is not purely by name. With AI-generated content, summaries, and zero-click searches, and algorithm-controlled reach, the old “build it and they will come” approaches aren’t as effective as they used to be. Today, Google might summarize your content without sending traffic to your website. Social platforms can limit organic reach, especially if it includes a link, while technically “owning” your audience. And ChatGPT can answer questions using your expertise without attribution. It’s easy for your content efforts and name to go unknown and unrewarded, but there is a possible solution. Savvy marketers aren't choosing between content and inbound, but uniting them so: (Spoiler alert: The Loop Marketing playbook essentially does this for you.) Ready to combine content marketing and inbound marketing? Here's your action plan: Create content addressing your audience‘s biggest challenges. Use keyword research and customer interviews to identify topics that matter. Focus on problems your ideal customers face before they’re ready to buy. In Loop Marketing, this is called the Express stage — you’re clarifying your ideal customer profile and crafting a style guide that aligns with their preferences. From there, you can share your style guide with AI to help you create content and personalize experiences. With your content created (perhaps with the aid of AI), add inbound elements to help you engage and ideally convert your audience. This means: This is where the Tailor and Amplify stages of Loop Marketing come in. Here you’re crafting content and experiences that feel personal to each audience member with the help of data enrichment and segmentation and diversifying your channels. Engagement doesn’t end with the form fill. You need to use marketing automation to deliver related content based on your visitors’ personal needs and past behavior. This may include creating email sequences that provide additional value while building toward conversion or even setting up retargeting ads on social media. In this combined approach, you’ll then track not just content views, but how content contributes to lead generation and revenue. Use attribution modeling to understand which content pieces influence conversions over time. All of this work proves ROI and guides future strategy (which is what Loop Marketing’s Evolve stage is all about). No, content marketing and inbound marketing are not the same thing. Rather, content marketing is a standalone tactic that lives under the umbrella of inbound marketing. To get more granular, content marketing focuses specifically on creating and distributing valuable content. In contrast, inbound marketing is a comprehensive methodology that includes content creation plus lead capture, nurturing, and conversion optimization. Neither — Just like Alec or Stephen. Content marketing and inbound marketing work best together. Content marketing attracts your audience, while inbound marketing converts that attention into business results. You need both for maximum effectiveness. Technically, yes, but it's not recommended. You can use forms to gather information from your target audience and email marketing to communicate with them, but what’s in it for them? Content marketing is the primary way to appeal to strangers and turn them into visitors. Without compelling content, your inbound strategy has nothing of value to fuel the “attract” phase of the methodology. ​​Think of it as one integrated budget rather than separate line items. You can get started with content marketing and inbound marketing for free with tools like HubSpot. As you scale, however, content creation typically requires 30-40% of your marketing budget (including tools, talent, and promotion), while the remaining budget supports lead capture systems, automation tools, and conversion optimization. For content marketing: Content management systems, design tools, analytics platforms, social media scheduling tools, and perhaps an AI assistant like Breeze. For inbound marketing: CRM systems, marketing automation platforms, landing page builders, and email marketing tools. Many platforms, like HubSpot, offer all of these capabilities. Absolutely! Many successful companies integrate both content marketing and inbound marketing to create comprehensive digital strategies. For example: Clearwing Productions, a live event production company, used HubSpot’s Marketing Hub to create content and follow up with leads, ultimately driving $8M in Revenue and 4,200% ROI. To meet the needs of both students and parents, Morehouse College built a new admissions blog on Content Hub — powered by Mr. Tiger, a custom assistant created in Breeze Studio — increasing on-site time by 27% and saving approximately $8,000 in agency contract hours. Today, content marketing and inbound marketing aren’t rivaling siblings competing for the lead — they’re the team behind a blockbuster. Content may be the lead actor — the one everyone comes to see, delivering the memorable lines and building trust with the audience — but inbound is the director, producer, and crew behind the scenes, making sure the movie actually sells. In 2025, you can’t just cast a star (a la create content) and hope people show up. AI, shifting algorithms, and shrinking organic reach mean your strategy has to be tighter, brighter, and more deliberate. That’s where inbound shines — and Loop Marketing keeps the whole franchise evolving. So, don’t frame it as “content versus inbound.” It’s “content and inbound” — a duo that’s most successful together.

  I’m going to be real with you: I’m exhausted. We blinked, and it felt like everything was run by artificial intelligence (AI). I’m being dramatic, of course, but AI is transforming how we work, play, and live faster than any tech I’ve seen in my decade-long marketing career.  With so many changes and unknowns, it’s been overwhelming even for the seasoned marketers and writers here at HubSpot. But the more we learn, the more we realize AI doesn't have to be the enemy of content writers. When used as a thoughtful addition to a human-led content creation process, AI can be a powerful tool that helps us all work faster and smarter – without sacrificing our human touch. Here on the HubSpot blog team, we've been experimenting with AI for a while now, and, like everyone, we’re still figuring it out. But we've also uncovered some exciting use cases that have streamlined some of our more time-intensive workflows, improved our output, and given us time back for deeper topic research. We’re not about gatekeeping, so let’s talk through how we’ve brought AI into our writing process. New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing.

I’ve penned around 800 articles as a content marketer, and even I still get writer’s block. When I had trouble in the past, I would chat with teammates for thoughts and ideas. But working remotely, there are fewer opportunities to talk casually like this. While AI can't replace chats with teammates, it has been a game-changer when I want help fleshing out an idea or thinking about how to approach a topic.  ""When I’m planning topics to cover, AI is an incredibly helpful brainstorming buddy,” shares Fellow HubSpotter Caroline Forsey. “I just throw an idea or even a general topic in a chat, and it kicks back angles, subtopics, and even potential titles. I don’t use its suggestions verbatim. But starting off with that creative spark saves me hours on ideation, letting the human team layer in voice and nuance from the get-go."" I couldn’t agree more. Recently, I was coming up with topics for HubSpot’s Breaking the Blueprint column, and had some trouble getting started. I tagged ChatGPT in for some help, prompting: “I‘m brainstorming article topics for a blog focused on giving marketers and business professionals from underrepresented groups advice and information they need to know. I want to target specific topics and concerns that are unique to these groups. I’d also like to touch upon topics related to the evolving role of AI on society and business. Can you give me some ideas?” Here's a peek at its response:  From there, I workshopped the suggestions and then met with a colleague to finalize the topics that best suited our audience. Like I said, AI doesn‘t fully replace bouncing ideas off a colleague, but it can provide a promising starting point when you’re stuck. This got my creative juices flowing, and that’s all I needed. Once we have our direction, it's time to dive into research. With our topic and angle defined, we need to understand our subject inside and out. This is where AI becomes our research powerhouse. As a content marketer and editor, my top concern is always quality and accuracy. I want to make sure the information I put in front of any audience is valuable and trustworthy. That means a lot of research, and good research takes time. Generative AI can help exponentially here with its ability to gather and summarize information from multiple sources, often in seconds. In fact, 47% of marketers report using AI for research already. When it comes to my own research process, I no longer have to filter through pages and pages of Google results to find the information I need. Instead, AI does most of the heavy hunting for me and wraps it up into a nice, easy-to-understand package. It doesn’t just give me a resource that might answer my question like a search engine; it gives me an answer directly. Forsey also sees the benefits of using AI for content research. She recalls, “Once, I needed to write a post — ironically — about the differences between ChatGPT, Google‘s Bard [now Gemini], and Bing’s AI-powered search engine. So, I asked ChatGPT: ’Can you tell me the differences between ChatGPT, Google‘s Bard, and Bing’s AI-powered search engine? Please put the pros and cons in a table format.’"" Shortly after, Caroline got back a detailed chart illustrating exactly what she wanted in a few short paragraphs:  Kaitlin Milliken, Senior Program Manager for our Freelance Writer Network, considers AI a big part of her research process as well. She shares how it’s helped her distill information about HubSpot products when writing. “When we write about products, I'll ask AI to explain in more detail what makes a certain product unique, and it gives me a list of specifics that can help inform my writing/editing."" The result? Using AI for content research and analysis has helped us dig deeper and uncover angles and understandings we may have missed or taken more time to come across without it.

Here‘s where things get interesting. We don’t just research and brainstorm with AI — we actually let it help us write. But there are parameters to our approach. The HubSpot blog team doesn’t just copy, paste, and publish AI-generated content. Rather, we use AI as a jumping-off point — that messy first draft to fuel ideas. One of the big reasons people read HubSpot articles is to learn from real-life marketers, sales, and service people. They want expert, verified examples and accounts of what works and what doesn’t. That kind of human expertise doesn’t come from AI. Human judgment and storytelling can’t be replicated. AI can’t produce lived knowledge, experience, and insights, but it can quickly gather initial, general information for our writers and editors to build into a final piece. Our writers use AI to save time, particularly for more general, educational articles. Many, including myself, use AI to draft the more straightforward sections of blog posts so they can focus on more impactful ones. For instance, I’ve often turned to AI to draft conclusions in recent months. With the bulk of my article content finalized, I pop into ChatGPT and ask it to draft a conclusion that matches the tone and ideas shared. From there, I refine and edit to my liking.  HubSpot writer Tristen Taylor also uses AI for blog intros and conclusions. She explains: “Before using AI, I often found myself rewriting introductions and conclusion paragraphs multiple times. Now that I have access to these tools, my time for completing blog articles has been cut down tremendously. AI can capture the topic, intent, and targeted keywords I need through refined AI prompts.” She adds, “It also allows me to refocus on the content or information of value that readers are looking for, instead of ruminating over small details at the beginning or end.” Our team has used AI in our creative brief and outlining process for over a year, and we‘ve started experimenting with AI-generated first drafts. So far, we’ve found AI drafting to be a helpful time-saving measure for some topics, though not all. For more general topics, such as “what is” and “how to’s,” it frees up more of our writers‘ and editors’ time to speak with other experts, gather unique examples and case studies, and “humanize” more generic topics overall, but AI can’t offer the original ideas needed for op-eds and thought leadership pieces. Read: How to Humanize AI Content So It Will Rank, Engage, and Get Shared in 2025  This is where our philosophy comes into play: “AI assists, humans lead.” AI supports ideation, drafting, and iteration — but people make the final call. AI gathers the pieces; we put together the puzzle. We never publish AI-generated content without thoughtful human editorial oversight. Learn more about our AI principles here. Numbers don‘t lie. They add credibility to our articles, but they don’t always tell their story clearly either. Here's how AI helps us make sense of our data. Numbers are not my strong suit. When faced with survey data or performance analytics, my head spins a bit, so when the prospect of using AI for data analysis came about, I couldn’t have been more excited. Earlier this year, I tested this use case for our State of Inclusive Marketing 2025 report. ChatGPT allows you to upload spreadsheets, so I attached the file and asked it to give me the most significant trends coming through the data.  Initially, the agent just returned a simplified spreadsheet (womp), but when I requested that it explain the qualitative trends in paragraph form, here’s what I got:  Could I have distilled these trends without the help of AI? Yes — but not in the minute or two it took ChatGPT. Senior Staff Writer and Website Editor Amy Rigby echoes this, reflecting on analyzing data for our website marketing report. ""LLMs are incredibly powerful at identifying patterns in data, especially ChatGPT’s o3 model. I used ChatGPT to help me highlight trends and further segment our website marketing survey data, resulting in a much deeper, richer report. I used to get frustrated with ChatGPT because its math was frequently wrong, but the o3 model has greatly improved.” While it’s tempting just to take the trends AI finds and run, double-check them. As we know, AI can make mistakes and make things up. This is the biggest challenge marketers report facing with AI, so take the time to spot-check your data to ensure the agent didn’t take any liberties. (Note: OpenAI just launched GPT 5, so hopefully, it’s improved in this area.) Great words deserve great visuals. Here's how we use AI to create compelling imagery and interactive elements that would otherwise be out of reach. So, I fancy myself a keen self-taught graphic designer, but writing remains my first and most refined skill. While written content still matters, consumer content consumption habits and buying behavior increasingly demand more visual and interactive mediums like videos, infographics, and quizzes. This kind of advanced content is out of reach for me and marketers with limited design and development skills. Thankfully, many AI tools are available now to help us. In fact, our AI Trends for Marketers report found that image and design generators are tied with general chatbots for the most popular AI tool marketers use.  Source Senior marketing manager and AI blogger Martina Bretous showcases generative AI's prowess in this area in her series “Is it Real or AI?” In it, she crafts a variety of multimedia content (i.e., video, audio, photos) using AI and challenges readers to see if they can identify them. For instance, this video of a beautiful yellow bird she featured was AI-generated on PikaLabs. Impressive, right? I also used ChatGPT to create this highly specific featured image of a piggy bank representing a Facebook budget.  Source Overall, AI is helping us create visual elements that can truly enhance the experience of our content and make the concepts easier to grasp. There are tons of robust AI video and AI image generators, including HubSpot’s Breeze, that you can use to do the same. Before any piece goes live, it goes through our editing process. And yes, AI plays a role here too — but not in the way you might expect. Whether we realize it or not, we’ve been using AI for proofreading and editing for decades. Think about it: spell and grammar check on Microsoft Word and Google Docs, “autocorrect” on iPhone, Grammarly — even non-writers rely on these tools to minimize misspelled words and grammar issues that could come off as negligent or unprofessional. Today, this has just gotten more advanced. ""People are rightfully concerned about AI’s potential to hallucinate in editing, but one thing that gets lost in the debate is that humans make mistakes, too,” reflects Rigby. In recent months, she has turned to AI agents as proofreaders and even editors for her articles. She continues, “Every writer knows the experience of being too close to their own work to see it clearly or being in such a rush to meet a deadline that they miss something. So, in addition to human editorial oversight, I see LLMs as another set of eyes, an extra layer of verification.”  “I fact-check all of my articles, but for additional assurance, I sometimes run them through ChatGPT or Claude and ask the AI to flag any errors, which I can then look at more closely. AI often does catch typos and errors that I missed.” She doesn’t just stop at grammar and spelling. Rigby recommends asking agents for feedback on even how to improve your writing. She says, “I sometimes ask AI to critique my work, poke holes in my logic, and point out weaknesses I may not have noticed.” I like to prompt it with something like, ‘Think like a digital marketer who will read this piece to decide which software to buy. What concerns would they have after reading this? What questions would come up that were not answered in the piece?” This helps me go back and re-examine and strengthen my arguments.” Rigby has also built a custom GPT called StyleScout for our team's internal use, which helps writers quickly scan their drafts for style inconsistencies. This was as easy as uploading our internal style guides to the GPT and letting AI handle the rest to ensure our content is consistently on brand. “Before I submit an article, I can run it through the GPT and get a line-by-line breakdown of anything that might violate our style guidelines. Yes, AI sometimes returns outputs that are overly pedantic or heavy-handed. That’s why human judgment always gets the final say. It's my responsibility to check that what it tells me is sensible and accurate. If it isn’t, I disregard it.""

The article is written, edited, and ready to publish. But our work isn't done—now we need to promote it. This is another area where AI shines. For some reason, writer’s block strikes hardest when I write meta descriptions or social posts for my blog articles. Perhaps it’s topic burnout, or I’m just too close to the pieces to distill the real golden nuggets of information. Whatever the reason, quickly generating the right messaging to promote your content is one of my favorite uses of AI. For instance, here’s what ChatGPT gave me when I asked it for some social copy based on this article:  It’s not perfect, but it gives me something to take and make my own. Jamie Juviler, HubSpot Manager, Staff Writing & AEO, has also leveraged AI for meta descriptions. He suggests feeding your introduction paragraph into an AI chatbot and then asking it to produce a 100-150-character meta description. The beauty of this approach is that AI handles the initial creative lift, freeing us up to focus on refining the message and ensuring it aligns with our brand voice. It may sound cliché, but the rumors are true: Marketing changes quickly. Thankfully, AI helps our blog team keep up with it. Juviler explains his approach. ""In this new realm of AEO and, more broadly, AI-powered marketing, I've been leveraging Gen AI as an information consolidation agent.” “We‘re constantly flooded with AI-related news, tips, and technologies, so whenever I come across a new piece of information — whether it’s a video, blog post, podcast, newsletter, etc.— I run it through a custom GPT I've set up that helps me determine whether it’s important or new. If it is, the AI modifies a personal tracking document I maintain for the industry as needed.” This system allows Juviler to stay on top of the stream of AI news without getting overwhelmed. This concept could also be used for other trends we cover, like email marketing, creator monetization, and social platform algorithm changes, or any topic of interest in your industry. Like everyone today, our team is learning as we go when it comes to AI. The technology has its benefits but also drawbacks, and with constantly evolving technology and unclear regulations, it’s a bit of the Wild West. But we’re figuring it out. We want to lead with transparency for our audience, so we’re committed to sharing how we utilize AI in our work as it evolves. You’re also welcome to dig into the HubSpot Media AI guidelines to learn more about our approach. We don’t know what tomorrow holds, but we know AI will help us all navigate this changing landscape. We know AI can't replace the humanity behind the HubSpot blog — and we will never take that human connection for granted.

  Today’s master has things kinda backward. But she shared with me one of the most clever strategies for collaborative content and brand awareness that I’ve ever heard. (And I talk to a lot of marketers, so that’s saying something.) And whether you’re working on brand partnerships, influencer marketing, or creator campaigns, you just might start doing it backward, too.  A stinging 53% of consumers outright distrust paid endorsements, according to a recent survey by the global service marketplace Clutch. And the better polished the content was, the more suspicious it looked. What’s more, 41% of consumers weren’t sure whether they trusted influencers more than brands. Which is really awkward because… wasn’t influencer marketing supposed to be the silver bullet against brand backlash? “Our survey makes it clear that consumer trust in influencer marketing has taken a hit,” Laxsav says, but she isn’t deterred. “When we got the data, we didn’t think, ‘We shouldn’t be doing influencer marketing.’ Instead, it was, ‘How do we do it better?’” She believes that the high number of scattershot paid posts created by one-off marketing campaigns have turned skepticism into a monster. So maybe the real silver bullet was the friendships we made along the way. No, really. Laxsav says the solution to the influencer backlash is building authentic relationships with content creators and/or partner brands that deeply understand your audience. And in that endeavor, Laxsav has it entirely backward.  Most folks begin a content campaign by asking a content creator to… y’know, create content. But Laxsav finds that it works best when you flip the script. (And, pro tip, this works with brand collabs, too.) “We’re a small brand, so the first step is just getting through the door. It’s hard getting the attention of these influencers. They’re getting thousands and thousands of emails.” So, instead, Laxsav asks influencers if they’ll agree to be interviewed by one of Clutch’s executives. “We’re not asking to appear on their channel. We want them to appear as a guest on our channels.” Then, and here’s the kicker, YOU create the content. “The number one thing is giving people something to share. We slice up [one interview] into two to three videos that they could promote. We give them graphics. We even give them social media messaging copy. You build this strong promotional toolkit, and you build that relationship. That’s how it starts.” But that’s not how it ends. The initial campaign acts as an ice breaker for further collaboration, which, in turn, creates the authenticity your audience is looking for. “It doesn’t just look like a stamp on a sponsored post. It actually looks like a long-term partnership.” And that’s where the next lesson comes in clutch. (I’m sorry.) (No, I’m not.) I asked Laxsav what I suspect is on all of our minds right now: What if I take all this time to make all this content and then they don’t share it? “There have been times we’ve interviewed CEOs and founders, and they just say ‘Thank you for the content,’ and it never gets shared. But whether they shared or not, you’re still building that relationship.” Remember that the goal isn’t simply distribution for your content. Whether you’re talking YouTube videos, social media campaigns, blogs, podcasts, or whatever, the goal is a trusted relationship with people your audience trusts. “You might work with a really big influencer and see a huge spike in traffic that one week. What is that really doing? Consistency is key. Consistently working with a variety of partners that are reaching your target audience.” “Don’t chase the glossy campaigns of the past. Today’s audiences are far more interested in transparency, relevance, and real value.” ""As marketing shifts from communication and storytelling to creating authentic cultural experiences, how are you or your company rethinking the role of Creative?"" — Alicia Mickes, Senior Creative Director, Magic: The Gathering Laxsav says: At Clutch, we’re making sure every content piece is supported by creative that feels rooted in real-life experiences. That means weaving in authentic perspectives from influencers and providers we quote, so the stories aren’t just polished narratives, they’re reflections of what’s actually happening in the market. Most recently, we’ve been testing more video content that’s intentionally lighter-touch rather than investing in big, glossy productions. We’re seeing that people consistently choose authenticity over stiffness. They want to hear directly from trusted experts in a way that feels conversational and relatable. For us, creative’s role is to amplify those voices and ensure every piece of content feels like an experience buyers can trust and connect with. Laxsav asks: When it comes to building partnerships for your event, how do you decide which people to collaborate with — whether that’s speakers, creators, or community leaders — to make sure they authentically represent your mission and resonate with your audience?

  Of all the consulting requests I receive, helping executives (or their teams) strengthen their LinkedIn presence is the most common — and for good reason. LinkedIn is no longer optional for executives. It's where top talent, investors, journalists, and industry peers vet leaders and build trust — often before they’ve ever met you.  I've seen this firsthand throughout my career. As a founding editor at LinkedIn, I worked on the LinkedIn Influencer program (now known as LinkedIn Top Voices) and watched how the platform evolved into the ultimate professional networking tool. Since then, I’ve created 20 courses as a LinkedIn Learning Instructor, earned LinkedIn Top Voice recognition with more than 320,000 followers, and wrote about the platform in my bestselling book, Unforgettable Presence. Most importantly, I've worked with C-Suite executives and senior leaders across Fortune 500 companies, startups, and beyond to help them shape a strategic, credible LinkedIn presence. What I‘ve learned is this: LinkedIn is the ultimate virtual watercooler. Here’s why it matters, and how marketers can make the most of it. Outline your company's marketing strategy in one simple, coherent plan. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. The benefits of an executive LinkedIn presence extend far beyond personal branding. Here are the four areas where I've seen the biggest impact. Today’s candidates make it a priority to research company leaders before applying for a job. A strong LinkedIn presence builds trust, signals authenticity, and can directly influence a candidate’s decision to join your organization. It also gives candidates a clearer picture of your company’s culture, values, and what it’s like to work with your leadership team. Maintaining a consistent presence on LinkedIn positions executives as industry leaders, opening doors to speaking opportunities, interviews, and strategic partnerships. (In fact, many of my own media opportunities have come directly from my LinkedIn.) Plus, regularly sharing insights or personal reflections can help spark ongoing conversations that reinforce an executive's leadership and credibility over time. Executive posts regularly outperform company posts in reach and engagement. Why? Because people ultimately connect with people. When executives actively engage in online discussions, they amplify the company's overall visibility by showing the human behind the brand. Their presence can make the company feel more authentic, relatable, and trustworthy. An executive’s LinkedIn profile often creates the critical first impression for investors, partners, and potential collaborators. A comprehensive and engaging profile not only sets clear expectations and establishes credibility but also allows the executive to proactively shape perceptions. It also reinforces your value — well before any meetings or sales conversations take place.  Investors, partners, and top talent want genuine human insights—not polished picture-perfect corporate profiles. An executive’s LinkedIn profile should make visitors feel they've genuinely “met” the leader behind the title. I’ve seen executives with strong in-person presence get negatively impacted by a weak online presence because their profile didn’t reflect who they really are. If someone meets an impressive CEO in person but their LinkedIn is missing a profile picture and has bare bones information, it’s going to impact how you perceive them (this is a real story I heard from someone, by the way!). Executives can avoid this disconnect by ensuring their executive’s profile consistently includes: Let’s take a look at these steps in action. Here's how I helped one CEO at a Fortune 500 consumer goods retail company grow a bare bones LinkedIn presence into a recognized LinkedIn Top Voice. This CEO’s team reached out to me knowing how important LinkedIn was for establishing credibility. With major announcements on the horizon, they expected a surge in profile traffic, and needed the page to reflect the leader behind the role. The CEO’s LinkedIn presence was minimal. His communications team was also uncertain about content strategy, unaware of LinkedIn best practices, and unsure how to authentically represent the CEO’s persona online. They needed fast, strategic guidance to boost credibility and visibility — especially as industry peers and potential partners would be paying attention. My approach was systematic and data-driven, prioritizing three steps. We jointly created a list of peer executives and competitors. Then, I analyzed the competition’s content from the past six months. We looked at everything: This analysis uncovered unexpected opportunities to differentiate the CEO’s presence (and also get a better understanding of what peers were doing), making their LinkedIn strategy even more impactful. Pro tip: Don't limit competitor analysis to your industry. Broaden your scope to include executives across sectors who excel on LinkedIn I evaluated the executive's profile using my custom rubric, scoring every single part of their profile and providing specific suggestions for improvement based on what I learned about this person and the competitive landscape.  We defined content themes and built a posting rhythm that balanced personal and professional content—while also staying realistic about a posting cadence (remember: you don’t want to start off with a schedule that will cause burnout or that is impossible to maintain, especially while ramping up). The team needed to get approvals, which took time, and wasn't super familiar with the platform. So, we started with simpler company news content first, then gradually incorporated more personal stories tied to professional insights. The impact extended far beyond what we initially expected. Within a few months, the executive became a LinkedIn Top Voice, which created a ripple effect throughout the organization. Other C-suite teammates became more active on LinkedIn after seeing the power of his presence firsthand, and it also boosted company culture as employees were excited to get to know their CEO better. Additionally, the communications team also gained a clearer understanding of the competitive LinkedIn landscape and how to use the platform effectively. Most importantly, we saw meaningful increases in the metrics that actually matter: follower count, profile views, connection requests, and direct messages. These are all clear indicators that people were not only seeing the content but taking actionable steps to stay connected. Pro tip: While nothing is guaranteed on LinkedIn, a good rule of thumb is consistent activity on LinkedIn (at least 1x/week) should give you enough data to assess what is working. When you double down on that, you will slowly start to see momentum (remember: LinkedIn is a long game!). If you‘re a marketer looking to boost your executive’s LinkedIn presence, here's your tactical playbook to get started.  Start by identifying two to three core themes that align with your executive‘s expertise and your company’s goals. These might include leadership, innovation, people development, or industry trends. Then decide on the tone: Are they visionary? Warm? Analytical? Direct? To uncover the right themes and tone, ask reflective questions like: These questions help you understand who they are — not just as a leader, but as a person — and give you stories to draw from later. Pro tip: Executives at large public companies often have less room for experimentation on LinkedIn. Make sure to coordinate closely with both the communications and executive teams to ensure alignment from the start. Text posts are often the easiest starting point. Add a photo when possible for better engagement (posts with images get 2x the number of comments). While video is having a big moment on LinkedIn, it‘s a heavier lift for executives and their teams. I don’t see many executives doing carousels. I recommend four types of LinkedIn content: personal, educational, professional, and promotional. Promotional posts should make up no more than 25% of your overall content. The balance between the first three depends on your executive and team goals, but mixing them creates a compelling combination. When you're starting out, company news (like earnings reports) is often the easiest content to create because it is more straightforward. As you build confidence, incorporate more personal stories — always tied to professional insights — like sharing experiences from industry events or leadership lessons learned. Pro tip: Don't underestimate the power of commenting on LinkedIn. It builds reputation and reach with minimal effort. Don‘t get caught up in vanity metrics. I actually don’t include engagement as a main KPI when working with executives, because no one has control over the algorithm or how people will engage. Instead, focus on metrics that indicate genuine interest: follower growth, profile visits, connection requests, and direct messages. These show that people are seeing your content and are interested in taking the next step. You don't need to post every day, but consistency is crucial for staying top of mind. According to LinkedIn Top Voices program requirements, aim for at least two original posts per month. Showing up regularly builds familiarity — and familiarity builds trust. LinkedIn is an essential tool for executives aiming to amplify their influence and elevate their companies. Don't wait for strategic milestones or annual reviews. Initiate conversations now about their online presence. Clarify what they want to be known for. Identify the stories that will resonate. The sooner you start, the stronger their presence will be.

 Italian company Bending Spoons flew largely under the radar — until last month. In a span of 48 hours, the company announced the acquisition of AOL and a massive $270 million raise, quadrupling its valuation to $11 billion, up from $2.55 billion set in early 2024. Bending Spoons has grown rapidly by acquiring stagnating tech brands like Evernote, Meetup, and Vimeo, then turning them profitable through aggressive cost-cutting and price increases. While the company’s approach is similar to private equity, there is one key difference: Bending Spoons has no plans to sell these businesses. Andrew Dumont, the founder and CEO of Curious, a firm that also acquires and revitalizes what he calls “venture zombies,” is convinced this “hold forever” strategy will become increasingly prominent in the coming years as AI-native startups make older VC-backed software businesses less relevant. “Our belief is that the venture power law, in which 80% of companies ‘fail,’ produces many great businesses, even if they’re not unicorns,” Dumont told TechCrunch.   Dumont defines a “great business” as one that can be purchased at a low price and quickly revived to generate substantial cash flows. This “buy, fix, and hold” strategy is the playbook for a growing number of investors, from the 30-year-old Constellation Software, which pioneered the model, to newer players, including Bending Spoons, Tiny, SaaS.group, Arising Ventures, and Calm Capital, according to Dumont. “Our whole model is to buy these companies, make them profitable, and use those earnings to grow the business,” Dumont said. In 2023, Curious raised $16 million in dedicated capital for buying software companies that have stalled and can no longer secure follow-on investment. Since then, the firm has bought five businesses, including UserVoice, a 17-year-old startup that raised $9 million in VC funding from Betaworks and SV Angel. “It’s a great business, but the cap table wasn’t aligned with keeping it. These funds get old, and these companies just sit there,” Dumont said. “We provide liquidity and also reset these companies for profitability.” Although Dumont didn’t disclose how much he paid for UserVoice, he said that stagnant companies sell for a fraction of the valuation commanded by healthy SaaS startups, which typically sell for 4x annual revenue or more. Based on our conversation, we estimate that “venture zombies” sometimes sell for as low as 1x yearly revenue. By implementing cost-cutting and price increases, Curious can push these businesses to achieve 20% to 30% profit margins almost immediately. “If you have a million-dollar business, you’re kicking off $300,000 in earnings,” he offered as an example.  They achieve the turnarounds because, unlike the stand-alone companies, they can centralize functions like sales, marketing, finance, and other admin roles, across all of their portfolio companies. “We’re not trying to sell the businesses we acquire and don’t need VC-scale exits, so we can balance growth and profitability more sustainably,” Dumont said. When asked why VCs don’t urge their startups to be profitable like Curious does, Dumont responded by saying: “Investors don’t care about earnings; they only care about growth. Without it, there’s no VC-scale exit, so there’s no incentive to operate with that level of profitability.” The cash generated from Curious’ companies is then used to buy other startups, Dumont said.   The firm plans to buy 50 to 75 startups like UserVoice over the next five years, and Dumont is certain he won’t have a shortage of targets to choose from. Curious is focused on acquiring startups that generate $1 million to $5 million in recurring revenue annually, a segment of the software market that, according to Dumont, private equity shops and secondary investors have historically ignored. “We’ve been doing this for a little under two years now, and we’ve probably looked at at least 500 companies, and we bought five,” Dumont said. While Bending Spoons’ big valuation hike may validate the “venture zombie” acquisition model, Dumont doesn’t expect a lot of new competition. Turning profits out of stagnation isn’t easy. “It’s a ton of work,” he said. Topics

 Posted: Finding a YouTube video that truly matches our interests can sometimes be a challenge. The video-sharing platform appears to have recognized this issue and is taking steps to address it with its new experimental feature, “Your Custom Feed.”  The new test aims to tackle the frustration users often face with algorithm-driven recommendations that sometimes miss the mark. Historically, YouTube’s algorithm has been reported to frequently misjudge user intentions. For instance, watching a few Disney videos could lead the platform to presume you’re a loyal fan, resulting in an overwhelming amount of similar content — even if that isn’t what you truly want. For those participating in the experiment, you’ll notice “Your Custom Feed” next to the standard “Home” button on the homepage. Clicking on it allows you to input prompts tailored to your interests.  Instead of passively scrolling through a stream of content that may not align with your interests, this feature allows you to actively shape your feed by entering specific prompts. For instance, if you want more videos about cooking, simply typing that into the custom feed will encourage YouTube to prioritize similar content in the future. While it remains to be seen how popular “Your Custom Feed” will be, the ability to customize a YouTube feed could be a game changer. This could be a more effective alternative to clicking on videos one by one and using the “Not interested” or “Don’t recommend channel” options. YouTube isn’t the only platform launching a customized feed. Threads was recently seen testing an algorithm-configuration feature. X is also working on a feature that would allow users to tag its AI chatbot, Grok, to adjust their feed.

 Character.AI announced on Tuesday that it’s launching “Stories,” a new format that allows users to create interactive fiction that features their favorite characters. The feature comes as an alternative to the company’s chatbots, which are no longer accessible to users under 18 as of this week. The change follows growing concerns about the mental health risks of AI chatbots that are available 24/7 and can initiate conversations with users. Several lawsuits have been filed against companies like OpenAI and Character.AI over their alleged role in users’ suicides. Over the past month, Character.AI has been slowly phasing out access for minors, and as of Tuesday, underage users can no longer chat with its AI characters at all. “Stories offer a guided way to create and explore fiction, in lieu of open-ended chat,” the company said in the blog post. “It will be offered along with our other multimodal features, so teens can continue engaging with their favorite Characters in a safety-first setting.” Interactive fiction has seen a surge in popularity over the last few years, so Character.AI’s pivot makes sense. But it may not be enough to satiate users who have become overly dependent on the chatbots — which is all the more reason why Character.AI’s decision to limit chatbot access was warranted. On the Character.AI subreddit, reactions are mixed. According to their comments, some teens say that while they’re disappointed, they think it’s ultimately the right move. “I’m so mad about the ban but also so happy because now I can do other things and my addiction might be over finally,” one user who identified themselves as a teenager wrote. Another said, “as someone who is under 18 this is just disappointing. but also rightfully so bc people over here my age get addicted to this.” It remains to be seen how teens will use the Stories feature, but the format is less psychologically dubious than roleplaying with chatbots. Unlike Stories, chatbots directly interact with users in open-ended conversations and can send unprompted messages even when users aren’t actively using the app.  Character.AI’s decision to age-gate chatbot access comes at a time when California recently became the first state to regulate AI companions. Meanwhile, Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) have introduced a national bill that would ban AI companions for minors altogether. “I really hope us leading the way sets a standard in the industry that for under 18s, open-ended chats are probably not the path or the product to offer,” Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand told TechCrunch last month.

 Posted: ChatGPT’s voice mode is getting more usable. OpenAI announced on Tuesday it is updating the user interface to its popular AI chatbot so users can access ChatGPT Voice right inside their chat, instead of having to switch to a separate mode. That means you’ll be able to converse with the chatbot and view its responses, including things like shared images, as you talk. Before, you’d be taken to a separate screen where you’d interact with an animated blue circle that represented the interface for ChatGPT’s voice. That screen also had a mute button and an option to record live video, as well as an X to return to the default text-based mode.  During these prior conversations, you could only listen to what ChatGPT was saying, instead of seeing it on the screen. That could be annoying if you missed a response, as you’d have to leave the separate voice mode to see the response as text. You can now use ChatGPT Voice right inside chat—no separate mode needed.You can talk, watch answers appear, review earlier messages, and see visuals like images or maps in real time.Rolling out to all users on mobile and web. Just update your app. pic.twitter.com/emXjNpn45w Now, the company says you can talk and watch your answers appear as ChatGPT responds to your questions. You can also review your earlier messages and view visuals during your conversations, like images or maps, in real time. The change will make it more natural to interact with the AI chatbot, as you can more easily move between speech and text in the same conversation; however, you’ll still need to tap “end” to stop the voice conversation when you’re ready to switch back to text.  This revamped voice mode is the new default and is rolling out now to all users across web and mobile apps.  For those who prefer the separate voice mode, OpenAI says they can still revert to the original experience under “Voice Mode” in “Settings.” Here, they’ll see a new option to turn on “Separate mode.”  Topics StrictlyVC concludes its 2025 series with an exclusive event featuring insights from leading VCs and builders such as Pat Gelsinger, Mina Fahmi, and more.

 Warner Music Group (WMG) announced on Tuesday that it has reached a deal with Suno, settling its copyright lawsuit against the AI music startup. WMG said in a press release that the deal with Suno will “open new frontiers in music creation, interaction, and discovery, while both compensating and protecting artists, songwriters, and the wider creative community.” WMG also announced that it has sold Songkick, a live music and concert-discovery platform, to Suno for an undisclosed amount. WMG had acquired Songkick’s app and brand in 2017, while Live Nation later acquired Songkick’s ticketing business. WMG says Songkick will continue as a fan destination under Suno.   As a result of WMG’s partnership, Suno will launch more advanced and licensed models that will replace its current ones next year. Downloading audio from the service will require a paid account, while users on the free tier will be limited to playing and sharing songs made on the platform. WMG’s artists and songwriters will also have full control over whether and how their names, images, likenesses, voices, and compositions are used in new AI-generated music. Artists signed to WMG include Lady Gaga, Coldplay, The Weeknd, Sabrina Carpenter, and more. “This landmark pact with Suno is a victory for the creative community that benefits everyone,” said WMG CEO Robert Kyncl in the press release. “With Suno rapidly scaling, both in users and monetization, we’ve seized this opportunity to shape models that expand revenue and deliver new fan experiences.” The news comes a week after WMG settled its copyright lawsuit with AI music startup Udio and entered into a licensing deal for an AI music creation service that’s set to launch in 2026.  WMG’s settlements with Suno and Udio mark a significant shift in the music industry’s approach to AI. Last year, Warner Music Group, Universal Music Group, and Sony Music Entertainment sued Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. While WMG has settled its lawsuits with Suno and Udio, Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment are also reportedly in talks to license their work to Udio and Suno and settle their lawsuits against the startups.  In a sign of investor confidence in AI music technology, Suno announced last week that it raised a $250 million Series C round at a $2.45 billion post-money valuation. The round was led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Nvidia’s venture arm NVentures, as well as Hallwood Media, Lightspeed, and Matrix.   Topics

 With holiday shopping on the horizon, OpenAI and Perplexity both announced AI shopping features this week, which integrate into their existing chatbots to help users research potential purchases. The tools are markedly similar to one another. OpenAI suggests that users could ask ChatGPT for help finding a “new laptop suitable for gaming under $1000 with a screen that’s over 15 inches,” or they can share photos of a high-end garment and ask for something similar at a lower price point. Perplexity, meanwhile, is playing up how its chatbot’s memory can augment shopping-related searches for its users, suggesting that someone could ask for recommendations tailored to what the chatbot already knows about them, like where they live or what they do for work. Adobe predicted that AI-assisted online shopping will grow by 520% this holiday season, which could be a boon for AI shopping startups like Phia, Cherry, or Deft (rebranded as Onton) — but with OpenAI and Perplexity pushing further into AI shopping experiences, are these startups in danger? Zach Hudson, CEO of the interior design shopping tool Onton, thinks that AI shopping startups with a specialized niche will still provide a better experience to users than general-purpose tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity. “Any model or knowledge graph is only as good as its data sources,” Hudson told TechCrunch. “Right now, ChatGPT and LLM-based tools like Perplexity piggyback off existing search indexes like Bing or Google. That makes them really only as good as the first few results that come back from those indexes.” Daydream CEO and longtime e-commerce executive Julie Bornstein agrees — she remarked to TechCrunch over the summer that she always viewed search as “the forgotten child” of the fashion industry, since it never worked particularly well. “Fashion … is uniquely nuanced and emotional — finding a dress you love is not the same as finding a television,” Bornstein told TechCrunch on Tuesday. “That level of understanding for fashion shopping comes from domain-specific data and merchandising logic that grasps silhouettes, fabrics, occasions, and how people build outfits over time.” AI shopping startups develop their own datasets so that their tools are trained on higher-quality data — something that’s easier to achieve when you’re attempting to catalog fashion or furniture, rather than the sum of all human knowledge. In Hudson’s case, Onton developed a data pipeline to catalog hundreds of thousands of interior design products in a cleaner manner, helping to train its internal models with better data. But if AI shopping startups don’t pursue that level of specialization, Hudson thinks they’re bound to be overshadowed. “If you’re using only off-the-shelf LLMs and a conversational interface, it’s very hard to see how a startup can compete with the larger companies,” Hudson said. The advantage for OpenAI and Perplexity, however, is that their customers are already using their tools — plus, their large presence lets them ink deals with major retailers from the get-go. While Daydream and Phia redirect customers to retailers’ websites to complete their purchases — sometimes earning affiliate revenue — OpenAI and Perplexity have partnerships with Shopify and PayPal, respectively, allowing users to check out within the conversational interface. These companies, which depend on mammoth amounts of expensive compute power to operate, are still trying to figure out a path to profitability. If they take inspiration from Google and Amazon, then it makes sense to look toward e-commerce as an option — retailers could pay them to advertise their products within search results.  But eventually, that could just exacerbate the existing issues that customers have with search. “Vertical models — whether in fashion, travel, or home goods — will outperform because they’re tuned to real consumer decision-making,” Bornstein said.

 If you’re a fan of the punk scene from the early 2000s, you may recognize Nick Gross, the drummer for the band Goldfinger.  Now he’s empowering young people to pursue their passions through his career exploration platform, Find Your Grind. The platform highlights alternative professions not usually emphasized in schools, including being a pop-punk band member, content creator, social media manager, and even a professional esports player. The company announced on Tuesday a $5 million Series A funding round, bringing its total funding to $8 million. The round was led by Echo Investment Capital, with support from Gross’ investment firm, Gross Labs. The investment will help expand the company’s “career readiness” programs across the U.S. Gross began his music career at 17 when his high school band, Open Air Stereo, gained significant exposure after being featured on MTV’s hit reality series “Laguna Beach.” Inspired by his experience, Gross came up with the idea for Find Your Grind after bringing students into his studio and seeing firsthand the challenges they face when exploring career options, often due to a lack of exposure in traditional schools. “Young people are entering a rapidly changing world of work,” Gross told TechCrunch. “As students prepare to leave school and enter into their professional careers, many are doing so without a strong sense of who they are, what they want, or how to navigate their next steps after school. Find Your Grind gives them the tools to explore not just what careers are out there, but what paths suit their strengths, interests, and visions for what they want their futures to look like,” he said.  Conventional career guidance often focuses on salaries and promotions, but this can feel disconnected from the rapidly evolving job market that the new generation is entering. Many of these students no longer aspire to become doctors, engineers, or lawyers. In fact, the World Economic Forum predicts that approximately 92 million jobs won’t exist in 2030. Traditional career exploration also tends to overlook the emotional aspect of choosing a career that aligns with a person’s values and desired lifestyle.  The startup’s platform focuses on four key competencies: self-awareness, career awareness, social awareness, and action awareness. It also features a Lifestyle Assessment that helps students identify three lifestyle paths based on their preferences. For example, they might discover that they align with the roles of an entertainer, a creator, or a humanitarian. Students then get a tailored next-step plan for what to do after graduation. Additionally, students can access videos and interactive lessons, and a group of mentors provides practical advice about their own career beginnings and the steps they took to achieve success. Notable mentors include Tony Hawk, Tony Hoffman, and will.i.am, among others.   There’s also an AI-powered “Reflective Coach” that provides personalized feedback and encourages students to dive deeper into their answers for better insights. Find Your Grind also runs workforce development initiatives, such as lifestyle fairs, that give students real-world experience. The company is rolling out its first program in Oklahoma City, working with local schools and training centers to help students discover job opportunities in their hometowns that align with their lifestyle preferences.  The company plans to launch more programs in additional cities in the future. So far, Find Your Grind has helped 100,000 students, according to the company. Gross told us he hopes that “over a million students” join the platform to be “more future-ready.”  Topics Lauren covers media, streaming, apps and platforms at TechCrunch.

 Posted: Microsoft’s AI chatbot Copilot will no longer be available on WhatsApp after January 15, the company has shared. After that date, users on WhatsApp won’t be able to chat with the AI unless they switch to Microsoft’s own Copilot mobile apps or use the chatbot via the web. The company explained it’s removing Copilot from the popular messaging app to comply with WhatsApp’s revised platform policies, which were announced last month. At the time, the Meta-owned messenger said it would no longer support general-purpose AI chatbots from using its WhatsApp Business API to serve their customers. Instead, it wanted to reserve those resources for other types of businesses. This change doesn’t mean that businesses can’t use AI to serve their own customers. It does, however, put an end to WhatsApp being a channel for AI chatbot distribution, which will impact companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, Perplexity, and others. OpenAI had already announced its plan to wind down its WhatsApp integration in January. Unfortunately for Copilot users on WhatsApp, their chat history isn’t being preserved when they make the move to Microsoft’s platform because the access to the chatbot on WhatsApp was unauthenticated. Microsoft recommends users who need to retain their conversations for future reference export them using WhatsApp’s built-in tools before the January 15 deadline.

 Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company Pony.ai said Tuesday it plans to triple the size of its robotaxi fleet by the end of next year as its pace of growth — and aspirations — accelerates.  The company, which has about 961 robotaxis in the fleet today, announced the goal during its third-quarter earnings. Pony.ai is targeting a 1,000-robotaxi vehicle fleet by the end of this year. Its goal is to “surpass” 3,000 vehicles by the end of 2026, the company said in its third-quarter earnings report. Pony.ai, which is publicly traded on the Nasdaq Exchange and Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, has spent the year ramping up its commercial operations. Today, the company offers commercial robotaxi services — meaning it charges for these rides — in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. The company also has aspirations to scale beyond the borders of China. Pony.ai is pushing into eight countries, including Qatar and Singapore, through partnerships with local companies as well as ride-hailing companies Bolt and Uber. The ramp-up in robotaxi services has had the dual effect of increasing revenue along with costs. The company reported revenue of $25.4 million in the third quarter, a 72% increase from the $14.8 million it generated in the same year-ago period. Shares of Pony.ai popped on the Nasdaq more than 6% following its earnings report.  Pony.ai said the rise in revenue was driven by robotaxi services and licensing its technology to other companies. The Guangzhou, China-based company brought in $6.7 million in revenue from robotaxi services, $10.2 million from its self-driving trucks called robotrucks, and $8.6 million in licensing and application fees.  The company’s expenses are still outpacing revenue. Pony.ai reported a net loss of $61.6 million in the third quarter, a 46% increase since the same period in 2024.  Pony.ai had $587.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of September 30, an amount that has decreased from $747.7 million in the second quarter of the year. Pony.ai said half of that decrease was from a one-off cash outflow that included investment into its joint venture with Toyota to support the production and deployment of its Gen-7 vehicle.  Topics

 Posted: Startup Fleet Space announced yesterday that it used its satellite-powered AI system to expand the scope of an already massive lithium deposit in Quebec. Finding a mineral resource isn’t easy. Only about three in 1,000 potential deposits end up becoming commercially viable, and it can take years to prove it by drilling core samples. Fleet Space says its approach can help target drilling operations, reducing decision time from weeks to days. The startup currently has a small constellation of satellites in orbit that use a range of sensors, including electromagnetic and gravity-sensing, to map the subsurface. Fleet Space then feeds that data into its software platform, which can provide a new location for drilling in as little as 48 hours. The Cisco project is currently estimating that it could produce up to 329 million metric tons of lithium oxide. Fleet Space said the results of lithium deposits might extend beyond Cisco’s current boundaries, saying the region has “district-scale potential.” Topics StrictlyVC concludes its 2025 series with an exclusive event featuring insights from leading VCs and builders such as Pat Gelsinger, Mina Fahmi, and more.

 Speechify has largely been a tool that helps you listen to articles, PDFs, and documents. The company is now adding voice detection features to its Chrome extension, including voice typing and a voice assistant that answers your questions. In the last 12 months, there has been a proliferation of voice detection tools, thanks to overall quality improvement in speech recognition models. Speechify is hitching its wagon to this train and launching its own dictation tool with support for English. Just like other dictation tools, Speechify’s voice typing corrects errors and removes filler words. In my short test of just more than a day, I felt there was a lot of room for improvement in Speechify’s tool. For instance, the tools work fine with Gmail and Google Docs, but on sites like WordPress, I have had difficulty in triggering the voice dictation and having it work well. The company said that it is adding optimization for popular sites gradually. In terms of accuracy, the word error rate was higher than some other tools like Wispr Flow, Willow, and Monologue. Speechify noted that its model learns faster as you use it more, and the error rate will gradually decrease. The startup is also launching a conversational voice assistant that lives in the sidebar of your browser. You can ask it questions about the website, such as “what are the three key ideas?” or “explain this in simpler terms.” While ChatGPT and Gemini have conversational modes, Speechify’s argument is that they are treated as an afterthought in their apps, and the startup’s own tool has voice as front and center.  “We believe that chat will always be the default user experience in ChatGPT and Gemini when you open the apps. That’s what their users expect. Voice will always be secondary – and in many cases, an afterthought for ChatGPT and Gemini. We know from several years of building Speechify that there’s a large portion of the market, which includes our users, who want voice as the primary, default setting every time they open an app and talk to AI,” Rohan Pavuluri, the company’s chief business officer, told TechCrunch over email. One notable hiccup with this is that Speechify’s assistant doesn’t currently work with browsers with in-built sidebar assistants like OpenAI’s Atlas, Perplexity’s Comet, and Dia. The startup is not too worried about that as the extension is largely intended for Chrome and its massive user base. Speechify said that it plans to include both voice typing and a voice assistant in all its apps across desktop and mobile gradually. The startup also wants to develop agents that complete tasks on your behalf. The startup didn’t reveal its full roadmap, but gave one example: making calls for you to make an appointment or wait on hold with customer support of a company. Other companies like Truecaller and Cloacked have been chasing similar targets.  Topics Ivan covers global consumer tech developments at TechCrunch.

 Posted: Spotify is planning to raise subscription prices in the U.S. in the first quarter of next year, according to a new report from the Financial Times. The move will mark the streaming service’s first price rise in the U.S. since July 2024. The company recently raised prices in several other countries, including the U.K., Switzerland, and Australia. A Spotify subscription currently costs $11.99 a month in the U.S. When the service first launched in the country 14 years ago, it cost $9.99 per month. The report says JPMorgan analysts have estimated that a $1-per-month price increase in the U.S. could increase Spotify’s annual revenue by about $500 million. Additionally, major record labels have been urging Spotify and other music streaming platforms to raise subscription prices, arguing that fees have not kept pace with inflation and remain low when compared to services like Netflix. The report comes a few weeks after Spotify announced that its founder, Daniel Ek, is stepping down as CEO. The company is replacing Ek with two co-CEOs: Gustav Söderström, the current co-president and chief product and technology officer at Spotify, and Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer.

 India has granted legal status to millions of gig and platform workers under its newly implemented labor laws, marking a milestone for the country’s delivery, ride-hailing, and e-commerce workforce — yet with benefits still unclear and platforms beginning to assess their obligations, access to social security remains out of reach. The recognition stems from the Code on Social Security — one of four labor laws the Indian government brought into effect on Friday, more than five years after the parliament first passed them in 2020. It is the only part of the new framework that addresses gig and platform workers, as the remaining three codes — covering wages, industrial relations, and workplace safety — do not extend minimum earnings, employment protections, or working-condition guarantees to this rapidly expanding workforce. India has one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing gig economies, with industry estimates suggesting that more than 12 million people deliver food, drive ride-hailing cabs, sort e-commerce packages, and perform other on-demand services for digital platforms. The sector has become a critical source of employment, especially for young and migrant workers shut out of formal job markets, and is projected to expand further as companies scale logistics, retail, and hyperlocal delivery.   Companies, from Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart to Indian quick-delivery apps such as Swiggy, Eternal’s Blinkit, and Zepto, as well as ride-hailing firms including Uber, Ola, and Rapido, rely on gig workers to run their businesses in the South Asian nation — the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market after China. Yet despite powering some of India’s most valuable tech businesses, most gig workers operate outside traditional labor protections and lack access to basic social security. The newly implemented labor laws are intended to change that, by defining gig and platform workers in statute and requiring aggregators, such as food-delivery and ride-hailing platforms, to contribute 1-2% of their annual revenue (capped at 5% of payments made to such workers) to a government-managed social security fund. But the details remain murky: What exact benefits will actually be offered, how workers will access them, and how contributions will be tracked across multiple platforms, and when payouts will begin all remain unclear, raising concerns that meaningful protections may take years to materialize. The Code on Social Security creates a legal framework for gig workers to be covered under schemes such as the Employees’ State Insurance, provident fund, and government-backed insurance. However, the extent of these benefits — including eligibility, contribution levels, and delivery mechanisms — remains unclear and will depend on future rules and scheme notifications. A key part of the framework is the creation of Social Security Boards at both the central and state levels, tasked with designing and overseeing welfare schemes for gig and platform workers. The central board must include five representatives of gig and platform workers and five representatives of aggregators, all nominated by the government, alongside senior officials, experts, and state representatives, per the Code. But there is little clarity on how decisions will be made, how much influence worker representatives will actually have, or who will ultimately control decisions on funding and benefit delivery. “We need to wait and see what exactly is in the government’s mind when it comes to implementing the four Codes, and what it hopes to do for gig workers,” said Balaji Parthasarathy, a professor at IIIT Bangalore and principal investigator of the Fairwork India project. “And then we also have to see what the states translate on the ground.” Parthasarathy noted that because labor policy in India is shared between the federal and state governments — listed  in the “concurrent list” of the Indian Constitution — state governments are responsible for designing, notifying, and administering many of the schemes needed to make the Code on Social Security operational for gig workers. That raises the possibility of uneven access, as some states move quickly to establish social security boards and roll out mechanisms, while others delay or deprioritize the effort due to political or fiscal constraints. Recent examples — such as Rajasthan’s stalled legislation after it was passed in 2023, and Karnataka’s Gig Workers Act, which was implemented soon after clearing the state assembly — underscore how workers’ protections may ultimately depend on where they live rather than the law itself. Platform companies have publicly welcomed the reform, but are still largely evaluating what it will require of them. An Amazon India spokesperson told TechCrunch the company supports the Indian government’s intent behind the labor overhaul and is evaluating the changes it will need to introduce. A spokesperson for Zepto said the company welcomes the new labor codes as “a big step toward clearer, simpler rules that protect workers while supporting ease of doing business,” adding that the changes will help strengthen social security for its delivery partners without undermining the flexibility that quick-commerce operations rely on. Food delivery firm Eternal, formerly known as Zomato, said in a stock exchange filing that the Social Security Code is a step toward more uniform rules and that it does not expect the financial impact to threaten its long-term business. Nonetheless, Aprajita Rana, a partner at corporate law firm AZB & Partners, said the change “will naturally have a financial impact” on India’s e-commerce sector, as worker contributions are now being formalized. It will also create new compliance obligations, requiring companies to ensure all workers in their networks are registered with the government-managed fund, determine whether individuals are associated with multiple aggregators and how to avoid duplicative benefits, and set up internal grievance mechanisms. “While the law has the right intent, gig worker structures in India are quite novel, and practical challenges in compliance will emerge as the law takes force,” Rana told TechCrunch. One of the biggest hurdles for gig workers seeking benefits under the newly implemented law will be registering on the Indian government’s E-Shram portal, launched in 2021 as a national database of unorganized workers. The portal had registered more than 300,000 platform workers as of the end of August, even though the government estimates India’s gig workforce at around 10 million. Trade unions, including the Indian Federation of App-Based Transport Workers (IFAT), which has more than 70,000 members, are working to help gig workers enroll so they can access the benefits. Ambika Tandon, a PhD candidate at the University of Cambridge and an affiliate of the national trade union Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said registering on the portal could mean lost wages for gig workers, since they would have to take time off to fill in required details. “These workers work for 16 hours a day,” she told TechCrunch. “They don’t have time to go and register themselves on the government portal.” CITU is also among the 10 major Indian trade unions calling for the withdrawal of the new labor laws, ahead of nationwide protests planned for Wednesday. The benefits of registering on the E-Shram portal are not compelling for many gig workers, Tandon noted, because the law does not address more immediate concerns such as fluctuating earnings, account suspensions, and sudden termination of accounts — issues that workers say matter far more right now than access to insurance or provident fund benefits. Trade unions often organize strikes to push platforms to address these concerns directly. However, such actions can disrupt everyone involved, including consumers, and put workers at further risk, as they are not paid while striking and may even face termination for participating. “While the social security rules have now been put in place, we demand a minimum wage and an employer-employee relationship for gig and platform workers, which are yet to be set by the government,” said Shaik Salauddin, founder president of the Telangana Gig and Platform Workers Union (TGPWU), which has more than 10,000 members in the southern state of Telangana, and national general secretary of IFAT. “We urge the government to obtain data from aggregators and secure their monetary contributions to the fund to start offering benefits to workers.” There is a broader debate over whether gig workers should be treated as employees — a question the new labor laws do not address. The Social Security Code defines gig and platform workers as a separate category, rather than extending them the rights and protections that come with employee status. In contrast, courts and regulators in markets such as the U.K., Spain, and New Zealand have moved toward recognizing platform workers as employees or “workers,” entitled to minimum wages, paid leave, and other benefits. In some U.S. jurisdictions, regulators and courts have pushed for platform workers to be treated as employees or similarly protected workers, though many ride-hail and delivery drivers remain classified as independent contractors. “With this law, the Indian government has settled this debate by saying that these gig workers do not sit within the ambit of employment or other protections,” Tandon said. The Indian labor ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Topics

 Google has partnered with Accel to find and fund India’s earliest-stage AI startups in a first-of-its-kind collaboration for the Google AI Futures Fund, launched earlier this year.  On Tuesday, Accel and Google announced a partnership to jointly invest up to $2 million in each startup through Accel’s Atoms program, with both firms contributing up to $1 million. The 2026 cohort will focus on founders in India and the Indian diaspora building AI products from day one. “The thought process is building AI products for billions of Indians, as well as supporting AI products built in India for global markets,” Prayank Swaroop, a partner at Accel, told TechCrunch. India is an appealing market with the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone base after China and its deep engineering talent. Still, it’s also a country that lacks frontier model development and hasn’t produced many companies pushing the technical frontier of AI, where development remains concentrated in the U.S. and China. Activity is starting to shift, however, as major firms including OpenAI and Anthropic have recently announced offices in the country, and global investors step up early-stage commitments. The bet is that a large, mobile-first population, expanding cloud infrastructure, and relatively low software costs could turn India into a meaningful AI market — if the ecosystem can translate talent and demand into original research and products. Swaroop said investments will be geared toward just about any area: creativity, entertainment, coding, and work. “The future of work here is more encompassing, which is essentially SaaS, and all other applications,” he told TechCrunch. “It could even be foundational models.” Swaroop said the firms will also try to identify areas where large language models are likely to advance over the next 12-24 months and look for Indian startups building in those directions. Alongside capital, founders will receive up to $350,000 in compute credits across Google Cloud, Gemini, and DeepMind, as well as early access to Gemini and DeepMind models, APIs, and experimental features. The program will include support from Google Labs and DeepMind research teams, co-development opportunities, monthly mentorship with Accel partners and Google technical leads, and immersion sessions in London and the Bay Area, including Google I/O. Founders will also get marketing support through Accel and Google’s global channels, as well as access to the Atoms founder network and Google’s AI builder ecosystem, the companies said. “India has an incredible history of innovation, and we firmly believe that its founders are going to be playing a leading role in the next generation of AI-led global technology,” Jonathan Silber, co-founder and director of the Google AI Futures Fund, told TechCrunch. “This is the Futures Fund’s first such collaboration anywhere in the world, and we chose India for a reason. Google has been a committed partner in the country’s journey to digital transformation, with multibillion-dollar investments over the years.” The partnership follows Google’s recent $15 billion plan to build a 1-gigawatt data center and AI hub in India. The company also announced a $10 billion digitization fund in 2020, which has backed firms including Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Walmart-owned Flipkart. Last month, Google partnered with Reliance to offer millions of Jio users free access to AI Pro. Google launched the AI Futures Fund in May as a dedicated vehicle to invest in and collaborate with AI startups globally. It has backed companies including Replit and Harvey, and has also invested directly in Indian startups such as Toonsutra and STAN. Silber told TechCrunch that Google would appear on the cap tables of startups funded through the partnership and would be “a material presence,” but declined to share how its equity stakes would compare with Accel’s. “This is our attempt to work with the market leader in the space who knows the country incredibly well, that can get us talking to earlier-stage founders at an early informative stage, that can move the needle,” Silber said. While using Google products is, perhaps, a given for applicants to this program, both Silber and Swaroop told TechCrunch there would be no requirements for startups to exclusively use Gemini or any other Google product.  “Sometimes, Google’s technology is the best. Other times, you’ll see Anthropic or OpenAI. So, we’re not putting firm requirements that say you can only use Google’s models,” said Silber. “What we’re hoping to do, though, is find a couple of different unique integrations that we can do with these companies that leverage Google AI technology.” Launched in 2021, Accel’s pre-seed and seed platform, Atoms, has backed more than 40 companies that have collectively raised over $300 million in follow-on funding. The firm expanded the program this year to include Indian-origin founders based overseas. The latest collaboration comes days after Accel’s partnership with Prosus to co-invest in Atoms X, backing early-stage Indian founders building large-scale solutions with the potential to serve the masses in the country. Silber told TechCrunch that Google is not structuring the partnership as a pathway to future acquisitions, or even future cloud customers. “We’re not a sales team, so we’re not specifically looking to sign up new cloud customers. That’s not our goal,” he said. “In terms of KPIs, our objective is simply to see the next wave of innovation in the AI space coming out of India.” Topics

 “When people see it, they say, ‘that’s it?… It’s so simple.’” That’s how OpenAI CEO Sam Altman describes how he thinks people will respond to seeing the company’s forthcoming AI hardware device for the first time.  The device is the result of the collaboration between OpenAI and Apple’s former chief designer Jony Ive. Not much is known yet about the product except that it’s rumored to be “screenless” and pocket-sized. Earlier this year, OpenAI acquired Ive’s design startup, io, to bring AI to the masses through some sort of tech gadgetry. This weekend, Altman and Ive talked more about their vision for their AI device in an interview led by Laurene Powell Jobs at Emerson Collective’s 9th annual Demo Day in San Francisco. Although OpenAI isn’t sharing specifics about the device, which is now a prototype, Ive and Altman were keen to describe the product in terms of its “vibe.” Most notably, Altman compared the device to the iPhone, dubbing the Apple smartphone the “crowning achievement of consumer products” thus far. He said he could define his life as those times before the iPhone and after.  However, Altman complained that modern technologies are filled with distractions.  “When I use current devices or most applications, I feel like I am walking through Times Square in New York and constantly just dealing with all the little indignities along the way — flashing lights in my face…people bumping into me, like noise is going off, and it’s an unsettling thing,” he said. The bright, flashing notifications and the dopamine-chasing social apps are where today’s devices are going wrong, Altman believes.   “I don’t think it’s making any of our lives peaceful and calm and just letting us focus on our stuff,” he said. The vibe of the AI device, meanwhile, would be more like “sitting in the most beautiful cabin by a lake and in the mountains and sort of just enjoying the peace and calm,” Altman noted.  The device he described should be able to filter things out for the user, as the user would trust the AI to do things for them over long periods of time. It should also be contextually aware of when it’s the best time to present information to the user and ask for input.  “You trust it over time, and it does have just this incredible contextual awareness of your whole life,” Altman added.  Ive confirmed at the event that the device should be available in under two years.  “I love solutions that teeter on appearing almost naive in their simplicity,” Ive told Powell Jobs in the interview. “And I also love incredibly intelligent, sophisticated products that you want to touch, and you feel no intimidation, and you want to use almost carelessly — that you use them almost without thought — that they’re just tools,” he said.

 Posted: OpenAI’s social app Sora launched with a controversial feature called Cameo, allowing users to deepfake themselves or others (with permission). The feature had a tenuous rollout — Martin Luther King Jr.’s estate had to get involved, to give you an idea of what went on — but now it faces a new challenge.  Apparently, Cameo — the app where you buy custom video messages from celebrities — can claim the trademark of the word “cameo.” U.S. District Judge Eumi K. Lee imposed a temporary restraining order that blocks OpenAI from using the word “cameo,” as well as any similar-sounding words or phrases, on Sora. The temporary restraining order issued on November 21, 2025 is set to expire on December 22, 2025, at 5:00 p.m. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for December 19, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. As of Monday afternoon, the Sora app still uses the “cameo” language, however.   “We are gratified by the court’s decision, which recognizes the need to protect consumers from the confusion that OpenAI has created by using the Cameo trademark,” Cameo CEO Steven Galanis said in a statement. “While the court’s order is temporary, we hope that OpenAI will agree to stop using our mark permanently to avoid any further harm to the public or Cameo.” OpenAI disagrees with the assertion that the company can claim exclusive ownership over the word “cameo,” the company told CNBC.

 The batteries that power Rad Power Bikes’ e-bikes “pose a risk of serious injury and death” and owners should stop using them, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The warning, issued Monday by the CSPC, is due to a risk that the batteries can ignite or explode. The CPSC has linked the batteries to 31 reports of fire so far. Twelve of those incidents resulted in property damage, and some of them even occurred when the batteries were not charging, according to the commission. “The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris,” the CPSC writes.  The battery fires and the CPSC warning are coming at a particularly bad time for Rad Power, which told employees earlier this month the company will shut down for good in January if it cannot find new funding. The CPSC said Monday that Rad Power “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” and claims the company said it is “unable to offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers” due to its financial situation.  Rad Power told TechCrunch it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the ebike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.”  The company said it “offered multiple good-faith solutions to address the agency’s concerns,” including upgrading customers to its latest batteries, which are not subject to the official warning. “CPSC rejected this opportunity. The significant cost of the all-or-nothing demand would force Rad to shut its doors immediately, leaving no way to support our riders or our employees.” (The Verge first reported Rad Power’s disagreement with the CPSC.) Rad Power claimed its batteries comply with “the highest industry standards” and said the “incident rate associated with the batteries in the CPSC’s notice is a fraction of one percent.”  “While that number is low, we know even one incident is one too many, and we are heartbroken by any report involving our products,” the company told TechCrunch in an email.  Owners can find out if they have batteries covered by the warning on the CPSC warning page. The commission is telling customers not to throw the lithium-ion batteries away, nor take them to traditional recyclers. Instead, they should take the batteries to “municipal household hazardous waste (HHW) collection center[s].” Topics

 Posted: Tesla may have celebrated a regulatory win in Europe a bit too soon.  Tesla claimed in a weekend social media post that Dutch regulator RDW was set to approve the use of its driver assistance system, known as Full Self-Driving, or FSD, in February 2026. The organization handles the licensing and registration of vehicles in the Netherlands and is seen as a critical step for Tesla to get approval for — and eventually roll out — FSD to consumers across Europe. “RDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026. Please contact them via link below to express your excitement & thank them for making this happen as soon as possible,” Tesla wrote in the post. It seems RDW isn’t quite in line with Tesla. The Dutch regulator clarified in a statement on their website that Tesla plans to demonstrate FSD Supervised in February. Bloomberg was first to report on RDW’s statement. “RDW and Tesla know what efforts need to be made to make a decision on this in February. Whether the schedule will be met remains to be seen in the coming period. For the RDW, (traffic) safety is paramount,” the statement reads. Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system called Autopilot. For an additional $8,000 fee, owners can upgrade to FSD Supervised, which provides additional automated driving features, including steering and lane changes on highways and surface streets. FSD is not self-driving and requires the driver to remain engaged with their hands on the wheel at all times. FSD is available in Australia, Canada, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, and the United States.

 There’s a new AI-powered toy for kids called Stickerbox, and, before you groan, I’m here to report that it’s surprisingly fun. Stickerbox, a product born out of Brooklyn-based startup Hapiko, is a voice-activated sticker printer. The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere. Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similar: “An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own.” After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over. Stickerbox, I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think. The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils. The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model. Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect. To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network. The setup process, which only took a minute, went off without a hitch. Using Stickerbox is simple. You push the button, describe an image out loud, then release the button to see your text appear on screen, followed by an AI-generated image as the printer spits out a physical copy.  There’s a serendipity to an experience in which you’re thinking of an idea and then holding it in your hand in a matter of seconds. The device’s thermal image printer requires no ink, and the paper is BPS and BPA-free, making it safe to use. The printed sticker is easy to tear off and then can be colored in with the colored pencils that come with the device. Your own crayons and markers also work. This combines the somewhat dopamine-driven experience of thinking up new things to print with the more calming or meditative aspects that come with coloring, similar to giving kids a coloring book. This ended up offering a healthy balance between using potentially addictive tech and then slowing down to engage in a real-world activity. It also helped to address potential boredom.  The more you use Stickerbox, the more you realize how complex your prompts can be. You don’t just have to ask for a basic image, like a “magical unicorn,” you can speak to Stickerbox with long, train-of-thought commands, and the AI parses what you mean. (This is particularly useful given that kids don’t tend to explain things in a straightforward fashion.) Hapiko, the company behind Stickerbox, was founded this year by CEO Arun Gupta and CTO Robert (Bob) Whitney. The pair originally met while working at the e-commerce marketplace Grailed, where Whitney was director of engineering and Gupta was CEO. (The company sold to GOAT Group in 2022.) Before Grailed, Gupta founded and launched the Y Combinator-backed hardware sleep tracker WakeMate.  Whitney, meanwhile, had worked as the director of engineering at The New York Times’ Games division, as the publisher pivoted from offering just crosswords to becoming a full-fledged gaming app, acquiring Wordle and launching other games like Connections and Strads. While that experience taught him a lot about what makes a great consumer-facing product, his later stint at Anthropic gave him a firsthand look at the advances in AI technology. However, it was his experience as a father that inspired Stickerbox.  When his son asked for a coloring page he didn’t have on hand, he turned to ChatGPT to make a printable image.  “I made it for him — a tiger eating ice cream. And he had never seen a printer before. I got out from under the bed our HP printer — literally dusted it off and printed it for him, and he ran off happily and started coloring it,” explained Whitney. “But, a minute later, the gears were turning, and he came back to me, and he was like, ‘I want a lizard riding a skateboard.’ And I was like, okay, cool, let me make that for you.” His son was so thrilled with the process of being able to say something and see it come to life that he realized there could be something to this.  “I just saw this look on his face of magic — like pure magic,” noted Whitney.  The co-founders were also thinking about how AI technology offered so many novel experiences, but most weren’t made for kids.  “Nobody’s building AI specifically for kids. So that’s what we’re looking for,” said Gupta. “What are the right guardrails? What are the right ways? What are the right products?”  They realized that kids have great imaginations, ideal for working with an AI image model.  “[They have] endless imagination and creativity … they’re learning new things every day. Every week, they’ve got a new obsession. We’re literally the first people in the world, I think, to put an image model inside of a box,” Gupta said. Under the hood, Stickerbox actually uses a combination of AI models, including its own proprietary tech focused on making the device kid-safe. It won’t respond to requests for harmful content, like violence or sexual imagery, and it filters out swear words. And if you try a somewhat more innocuous command, like “boobs,” it just prints a random sticker that may be vaguely related to the word. (For instance, you might get a generic cartoon girl, but not a large-chested one.) After trying and failing to get a naughty result, most kids will likely go back to just prompting the device for silly images instead.  “We want to be the trusted brand for parents where you don’t have to look over your kid’s shoulder and be like, ‘what are they doing? How are they using this?,” said Gupta.  For now, the company generates some revenue from the device sales, but it keeps the cost of restocking paper low. It’s just $5.99 for three rolls, which equates to 180 stickers. (It’s currently running a promotion that offers six rolls with every purchase now.) Over time, the team plans to explore adding premium features, including a way to upload your own image to imagine yourself in fantastic scenarios or collaboration tools. As a Wi-Fi-connected device, Stickerbox is regularly updated with new firmware and features. In tests, for instance, we were able to print some recognizable characters, but a more recent update added new guardrails to guide kids toward more original designs. A soon-to-launch companion app also lets you view past creations and save favorites, and could ultimately serve as the home for premium features. Stickerbox is backed by $7 million in funding from Maveron, Serena Williams’ Serena Ventures, the Allen Institute’s AI2 incubator, and various angels, including Matt Brezina, and product leaders from other consumer apps. My kids got their stickerbox last week and have been ripping through rolls.  It’s been fun to see them turn stickers into creative art projects pic.twitter.com/lMXWoCPiTN  Topics

 Amazon Web Services is making a sizable new investment in infrastructure designed to boost AI capabilities for U.S. government organizations. AWS announced Monday it is investing $50 billion to build AI “high-performance computing infrastructure” purposefully built for the U.S. government. The buildout is meant to expand federal government agencies’ access to AWS AI services. The project will add 1.3 gigawatts of compute and will expand government access to AWS products, including Amazon SageMaker AI, model customization, Amazon Bedrock, model deployment, and Anthropic’s Claude chatbot, among others, according to the company. AWS expects to break ground on these data center projects in 2026. “Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” AWS CEO Matt Garman said in the company’s press release. “We’re giving agencies expanded access to advanced AI capabilities that will enable them to accelerate critical missions from cybersecurity to drug discovery. This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.” AWS is no stranger to working with the U.S. government. The entity began building cloud infrastructure for the U.S. government back in 2011. Three years later it launched AWS Top Secret-East, the first air-gapped commercial cloud to work with classified workloads. AWS introduced AWS Secret Region in 2017, which has accredited access to all levels of security classification. Tech giants have increasingly pitched their AI services to the U.S. government over the past year. OpenAI launched a version of ChatGPT designed exclusively for federal U.S. government agencies in January. OpenAI announced a deal in August that gave government agencies access to the enterprise tier of ChatGPT for just $1 a year. That same month, Anthropic announced it was also giving the U.S. government access to the enterprise tiers of its Claude chatbot for $1. Google announced “Google for Government” for even less, charging 47 cents for the first year, shortly after. Topics

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2025/11/25/scientists-may-have-finally-seen-dark-matter-after-100-year-search/,Scientists May Have Finally Seen Dark Matter After 100-Year Search,"Gamma rays from the Milky Way may mark the first direct detection of dark matter, a potential milestone in modern physics. ",,"ByJamie Carter, Senior Contributor. One of the most mysterious components of the universe — dark matter — may have finally been found after a century-long search. Dark matter emits no light or energy, so it is undetectable using telescopes. Scientists using data from NASA's Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, which has been orbiting Earth since 2008, have detected the aftermath of dark matter particles colliding. Although stronger evidence is required, it could be a breakthrough in particle physics. Dark matter is thought to account for about 85% of matter in the universe and is thought to interact only with gravity. It’s therefore hypothetical; its existence is only inferred by its effect on other things. Its existence was first proposed in 1933 by Swiss-American astronomer Fritz Zwicky, who observed that the galaxies in the Coma Cluster were behaving as if they had many hundreds of times more mass than they had. He explained it by postulating the existence of invisible particles that exert a gravitational force. The particles that make up dark matter are invisible and absorb, reflect or emit no light or energy, according to NASA, so it’s impossible to detect directly — until now, perhaps. A new study published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics, led by Professor Tomonori Totani from the University of Tokyo, reports the detection of gamma rays matching theoretical predictions for dark matter particle interactions. “If this is correct, to the extent of my knowledge, it would mark the first time humanity has ‘seen’ dark matter,"" said Totani. One leading theory suggests that dark matter consists of weakly interacting massive particles, WIMPs. A key prediction of this theory is that when two WIMPs collide, they annihilate and emit gamma-ray photons with very specific energies. Some scientists have therefore focused their efforts on finding evidence of those gamma-ray photons. NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has been looking for evidence of just that in the center of the Milky Way, where dark matter is believed to be concentrated. Totani’s research focused on this region and identified the gamma-ray photons that theoretical models predict would result from ""WIMP annihilation."" “We detected gamma rays with a photon energy of 20 gigaelectronvolts (or 20 billion electronvolts, an extremely large amount of energy) extending in a halolike structure toward the center of the Milky Way galaxy,"" said Totani. ""The gamma-ray emission component closely matches the shape expected from the dark matter halo."" Despite the promising data, caution is warranted. As well as undergoing independent verification, scientists will require further evidence from other dark matter-rich regions. One key test would be to find gamma-ray signatures similar to those in dwarf galaxies, which also host high concentrations of dark matter. ""It turns out that dark matter is a new particle not included in the current standard model of particle physics,"" said Totani. “This signifies a major development in astronomy and physics.” Gamma rays are the most energetic form of light. Launched in 2008, the NASA’s Fermi space observatory helps scientists to research everything from the leftovers of stars and spinning pulsar stars to the origin of cosmic rays and gamma-ray bursts. Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes."
https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbishop1/2025/11/25/in-a-new-era-forterra-pursues-both-defense-and-commercial-launches/,"In “A New Era,” Forterra Pursues Both Defense And Commercial Launches",Forterra's Series C fundraise will power their joint focus on military and commercial autonomous trucks. What are their prospects for this dual approach?,,"ByRichard Bishop, Contributor. When it comes to vehicle technology, defense needs and commercial logistics needs have historically had very little overlap. With a unique take on these domains,  Forterra frames itself as “the company redefining autonomy and mission system interoperability for defense and logistics.”  In this article, I’ll explore what this really means.   Forterra was founded as Robotic Research in 2002 and has been a key player in the development and deployment of ground autonomy systems in defense ever since then. The company is headquartered in Clarksburg, Maryland, just up the road from the U.S. Capitol.   Forterra delivers autonomous mission systems for defense, which entails an eclectic set of Operational Design Domains encompassing self-driving land systems to coordinated swarms of robotic systems and more. As framed by Forterra, the company “builds scalable, robust, mission critical hardware and software platforms that empower its customers to deploy autonomy as a force multiplier, extending reach, survivability, and effectiveness across the battlespace and industrial applications,” adding that its approach is “the operating standard for autonomy in the most complex, high-stakes environments.” Forterra entered a new phase in their journey earlier this month, closing a $238 million Series C funding round consisting of equity and debt. The round was led by Moore Strategic Ventures, joined by new investors including Salesforce Ventures, Franklin Templeton, Balyasny Asset Management, 645 Ventures, Hanwha Asset Management, and 9Yards Capital, alongside participation from existing investors XYZ Venture Capital, Hedosophia, and Enlightenment Capital. Doubling down on their investment into Forterra, Crescent Cove provided both equity and debt, showing continued support since Forterra’s Series A in 2021.  “Autonomous systems are an operational imperative,” said Josh Araujo, CEO of Forterra. “This funding propels Forterra’s mission to be the connective tissue of modern operations. Our interoperable mission modules and autonomous stack are already enabling a new generation of platforms to move, sense and act without limits.”  Forterra’s fund-raising track record so far is notable. In 2021 the company raised a $228M Series A, which was succeeded by a $75M Series B round last year.  Forterra recently announced its acquisition of mobile mesh network company, goTenna, in addition to announcing a series of partnerships, including Volvo Defense, BAE Systems, CHAOS Industries, and RTX’s Raytheon.  The Commercial Play: Supporting On-Property Logistics Forterra has forged a production relationship with vehicle manufacturer Kalmar which will result in new terminal tractors equipped with Forterra’s “AutoDrive” autonomous driving system. Kalmar’s  Ottawa AutoTT™ is an autonomous terminal tractor designed to improve efficiency and safety in distribution centers, container terminals, and industrial yards. The AutoTT™ is currently undergoing its second round of testing as Kalmar moves closer to bringing it to market, with full production anticipated by 2026.  The partnership between Kalmar and Forterra was established in early 2024. What Are The Implications Of Pursuing Government and Commercial Markets In Parallel? Is It Wise?  Industry leaders have asserted that the combination of military contracts and commercial sales, using essentially the same autonomy technology, is powerful.  How does this work in terms of revenues?  In the case of Forterra, will current military contracts provide revenue “now” while waiting for AV yard truck sales volumes to scale up over several years?   Or will both military and commercial revenues take years, such that venture funding is needed to keep the company solvent in the interim?   How does investment fundraising interact with revenue from both military and commercial sales? I posed these questions to Scott Sanders, Forterra’s Chief Growth Officer. “Defense and commercial programs move on different timelines but reinforce each other,” he said. “Defense contracts often generate revenue earlier by funding mission critical deployments and production programs, while also proving out the technology for broader use. Commercial sales, especially for autonomous yard trucks, take longer to build as production and customer adoption ramps up.”   As he sees it, “Defense work can bring in revenue now, but both sides still require investment to scale. Fundraising bridges that gap until commercial volumes grow and the business reaches steady revenue across both markets.”  For perspective from the investment domain, I had a wide-ranging chat with James Cross, Co-Head of Private Investing at Franklin Templeton - Franklin Equity Group and Managing Director of Franklin Venture Partners, one of the key investors in the Forterra Series C fundraise. “We are thrilled to partner with Forterra as they build a category-defining company,” he said. Mr. Cross added that the fresh infusion of cash “will be used to expand Forterra’s product offerings in the communications and command and control space while also scaling production of edge compute offerings for defense applications.”   On the commercial side, Mr. Cross noted that “we’re here now” in fielding autonomy, after much skepticism over the last decade or so from potential end users and the public.  But having been an observer of U.S. Defense procurement over the last three decades, I’ve seen the powers-that-be going through numerous cycles of running hot, then cold, in terms of moving from R&D into deployable systems at scale. Not only that, but who knows what happens to funding and priorities when a new Presidential administration arrives?  The DARPA Challenges in the early 00’s were meant to super-charge the application of autonomy specifically for the military; the result was the launch of commercial autonomy powered by venture capitalists, while the Army itself trundled along at its usual pace. Is it different now?  Mr. Cross pointed out a recent paradigm shift within the Army that creates the new opportunities for commercial autonomy providers.  Over many decades, the Army (in particular) has taken the role of specifying what systems they wanted and how they should be built, with waves of procurements awarded to a stable of defense contractors.  This program management style did not leverage commercial developments in a significant way. “Now, we are at an inflection point,” Mr. Cross said.  “There is now a desire within the Army to procure commercial off the shelf technologies, which is good for companies like Forterra.""   Compared to the Air Force and Navy, which innovate on new platforms, the Army can rapidly integrate autonomy by retrofitting its existing fleet of surface vehicles.  The same can be said of the Marine Corps. A human-driven military convoy is a complex endeavor, Mr. Cross said.  “Drivers must be trained and certified.  In certain settings, convoys can be completely automated; in others, autonomous ‘followers’ will support human-driven ‘leaders.’  In either scenario, there’s an opportunity to completely offset autonomy costs compared to human-driven convoys. More importantly, autonomy also helps to keep humans out of harm's way.""  So rather than seeing military customers as an uncertain play, as I posited, Mr. Cross has a different view.  “There is very little doubt about the tech anymore. For autonomy, we are seeing that military revenues  are materializing quicker than commercial revenues,” he said. Clearly, this view underpins Franklin Templeton’s investment in Forterra. Franklin Templeton is active broadly across the autonomy space, whether ground, air, or sea.  Other autonomy investments include Applied Intuition, Saronic, and Anduril.  Defense Wins And Ongoing Programs  Forterra’s fresh round of funding comes on the heels of a string of contract wins for the company, including the first ground autonomy production contract with the DoD for ROGUE Fires with the Marine Corps, a $114M prime contract to deploy autonomous breaching systems for the Army, a Phase II award for the Army’s GEARS program focused on automating the Army’s heavy logistics fleet, and a $4.8M contract for the Army’s UxS Program.  A Promising New Era Even if we’re in “a new era” as Mr. Cross noted, working in the military sector takes staying power and fortitude.  There’s a lot cooking here for the autonomy players that can endure for the long run, while leveraging carefully selected commercial markets in parallel.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/billkoenig/2025/11/25/detroit-automakers-post-bailout-companies-still-struggle/,Detroit Automakers Post-Bailout: Companies Still Struggle,"In the late 2000s, two of Detroit's three automakers got a U.S. bailout. In 2025, all three companies face big challenges.",,"ByBill Koenig, Contributor. In the 2000s, two of the three Detroit automakers (General Motors Co. and Chrysler) received a U.S. bailout. The third, Ford Motor Co., avoided that fate because of a massive borrowing program where the company put its assets – including its Blue Oval logo -- up for collateral.  More than 15 years later, the Detroit Three (formerly the Big Three) are still struggling. During the bailout, GM and the U.S. negotiated whether that automaker would move its headquarters from Detroit to the automaker’s technical center in the suburb of Warren to save money. That was the version told by Steven Rattner, a U.S. negotiator in a 2010 book. GM’s headquarters remained in Detroit. Today? GM is downsizing its HQ footprint from Detroit’s Renaissance Center to a new downtown development, a move announced in April 2024. The Warren technical center will be home to much of GM’s Detroit-area footprint with the move. With the bailout, Chrysler linked up with Italy’s Fiat with the merged company dubbed Fiat Chrysler. Since then, Fiat Chrysler merged with France’s PSA Group to form Stellantis. Chrysler helps Stellantis financial results with its pickups and SUVs. But, outside of Detroit, the Chrysler name isn’t remembered much. Ford’s borrowing program (made in 2006) provided that automaker enough cash to avoid bankruptcy and a U.S. bailout. In November Ford unveiled a new headquarters. The new structure aims to boost collaboration while minimizing the time members of various teams need to travel between buildings in Ford’s Dearborn, Michigan campus. Ford wants to behave more like a tech company. Still, all three automakers face severe challenges from Chinese automakers. That county’s auto industry is moving faster to design vehicles and reduce costs. Chinese automakers can develop new models in 14 to 18 months compared with 36 to 48 months for traditional automakers. What’s more the Detroit Three have been whipsawed by Washington. The Biden administration wanted the industry to move full speed ahead on electric vehicles. The Trump administration pumped the brakes. The U.S. bailout bought time but wasn’t a permanent solution."

Their work ethic isn’t merely conscientiousness; it’s a form of self-governance. They also routinely hold themselves to standards that often exceed the environment around them. But this is also why burnout shows up differently for them.  Often, they don’t show the typical signs of withdrawal, performance decline and emotional volatility until it’s too late. This is because high-functioning personalities are skilled at overriding internal signals. They often spend years developing a kind of emotional callus that can boost their capacity to push past tiredness, to downplay stress and convince themselves they’re fine because, technically, they are still doing the work. However, this can make burnout particularly insidious for them. A high-functioning person can be actively unraveling while still appearing productive, competent or even exceptional. And if an individual has always used achievement as a compass, it becomes remarkably easy to miss the internal clues that could protect them in the long-run. For anyone who suspects they might fall into this pattern, or who sees it happening in someone they care about, three indicators tend to surface early, according to research. Here are the signs psychologists believe matter most. One of the paradoxes of high-functioning burnout is that productivity continues long after the emotional system begins to fail. High-functioning personalities keep delivering, keep showing up for meetings and keep hitting deadlines as if they’re a matter of habit. They show up, sometimes even better than before, because they’ve learned to operate on discipline rather than desire. This is a well-established pattern in burnout research. A recent comprehensive review of research highlights that emotional exhaustion often develops long before performance declines. It’s the first crack in the system, but high-functioning people usually have developed buffers against them. Perfectionism, duty-orientation and persistent self-demand are all tools they use to continue to produce output despite increasing depletion. In real life, this exhaustion doesn’t look dramatic, and that’s perhaps what makes it so dangerous. A high-functioning personality won’t collapse at their desk, because the signs of burnout will be subtle. They might wake up with a heaviness that their morning coffee won’t dissolve anymore. Or, they might rely on momentum, rather than engagement, to get through a tough day. One of the worst symptoms is finishing a task successfully and feeling nothing but the desire to lie down. That’s the tension at the heart of high-functioning burnout. People feel depleted internally but appear steady externally, and they often believe their external steadiness to be proof that nothing is wrong. Psychologically, this is extremely risky. Functioning isn’t the same as flourishing, and emotional exhaustion, if left unchecked, is the strongest predictor of the later stages of burnout, including withdrawal and collapse. If you’re chronically tired but still performing, don’t mistake performance for health.  The second sign tends to appear more suddenly, and it’s the one that high-functioning people often find most unsettling. It’s the realization that burnout doesn’t just drain energy, but that it also affects cognition. And unlike emotional signals, cognitive changes are harder to explain away as personality or preference. Research supports this decisively. A large-scale 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis examined dozens of studies comparing people with clinical burnout to healthy controls. The findings were remarkably consistent: burnout is associated with measurable impairments in working memory, attention, processing speed and executive function. Translated into daily experience, this looks like: When burnout begins to set in, tasks that once felt automatic will require increasing conscious effort. And skills like multitasking, that may previously have been a point of pride, start to feel like liabilities. Over time, even simple decision-making can turn into an ordeal. What makes this especially challenging for high-functioning people is that cognitive sharpness is often core to their identity. They’re used to being the reliable thinkers, the fast processors, the person who can hold multiple strands of information in their head without losing the thread. When this begins to falter, it can feel alarming: not because they fear failure, but because their sense of self is tied to competence. The important nuance to recognize here is that this symptom isn’t a character flaw. It’s not laziness, distraction or lack of discipline. It’s a bona fide neurocognitive response to chronic stress and exhaustion. Burnout disrupts the prefrontal cortex (the brain region central to complex thinking) and the effects show up in precisely the domains high-functioning individuals rely on most. The good news is that cognitive impairment in burnout is reversible. But catching it early requires one to pay attention to their internal and external cues without judgement. If your mind feels slower, foggier or less reliable than it used to be, it may not be a sign that you’re slipping. It may be a sign that you’re burning out. The third sign is often the subtlest, but also the most telling: a muted emotional response to success. High-functioning people typically carry a strong relationship with achievement. To them accomplishment, even when private, generates strong momentum. So when these emotional circuits begin to dull, they need to start paying attention to that signal. Burnout research has long documented the emotional consequences of chronic stress. A study published in Clinical Psychology Review, for instance, suggests that burnout and depression overlap substantially, especially in their affective symptoms. Both conditions involve emotional blunting, reduced pleasure and a diminished capacity to feel joy. The distinction lies in scope: burnout is tied to the domain of work, while depression affects life more globally, and this point of distinction matters. If you achieve something meaningful and feel nothing — no pride, no spark, no internal lift — that’s not simply fatigue. It may indicate that burnout has begun to erode your reward system. While it may not seem alarming or dramatic at first, emotional flattening is psychologically significant. It suggests the nervous system has shifted into conservation mode, and that it’s trimming away positive affect in order to preserve basic functioning. And since high-functioning people tend to evaluate themselves by outcomes rather than internal states, they may notice their victories but ignore their muted reactions to them. They assume they’re simply tired, busy or in a transitional phase. But a lack of joy in achievement is not a trivial change. It’s one of the clearest signals that burnout is tipping into its later, more serious stages. And if ignored, can drift into a depressive profile.

Stranger Things Season 5 is just around the corner, with Volume 1 of Netflix’s hit sci-fi series landing this week. With new episodes just around the corner, we’re about to find out what’s happening in Hawkins, Indiana with Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Will (Noah Schnapp), Caleb (Lucas Sinclair), and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) as they face off for a final showdown with the Upside Down necromancer, Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower). Max (Sadie Sink) is still in the coma from Season 4, and judging by the trailers we’ve seen, being in a coma in the Hawkins hospital is not a very safe place to be. While we lost poor Eddie Munson (Joseph Quinn) at the end of Season 4, Stranger Things still has the bulk of its main cast still standing. Hopper (David Harbour), Joyce (Winona Ryder), Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), Robin (Maya Hawke), Joe (Steve Harrington) and Nancy (Natalia Dyer) are all set to rejoin the fight against evil. Stranger Things Season 5 is reportedly one of the most expensive seasons of television ever filmed, with a budget somewhere between $400 and $480 million USD, which translates to $50 to $60 million USD per episode. We’ll only see half of these episodes with the release of Volume 1. The first four episodes of Stranger Things 5 release Wednesday, November 26 just as everyone gets off of work – and out of school – for the Thanksgiving holiday. It’s the perfect holiday watch party event, and Netflix is keeping that philosophy alive with the release of Volume 2 on Christmas Day and the series finale on New Year’s Eve. Stranger Things 5, Volume 1 won’t release at midnight local time, like so many other Netflix shows do, but rather earlier in the day so that subscribers have plenty of time to watch and discuss the show that same evening. Undoubtedly, we will all be left on a massively frustrating cliffhanger – though at least the wait for Volume 2 will be relatively short (unlike the three-year gap between Season 4 and 5). Here’s the exact time Stranger Things 5 releases on Netflix in your timezone: Season 4 was split up across four major locations, with groups of our heroes scattered across Hawkins, California, Russia and the Upside Down. In Hawkins, students begin dying in mysterious and often grotesque ways, and the authorities turn to D&D player and affable outcast, Eddie, as their top suspect. We learn that it’s actually the evil Upside Down entity, Vecna, targeting these teens. He sets his sights on Max, still grieving over Billy’s death, who uses her walkman and Kate Bush’s “Running Up That Hill” to protect herself from his dark sorcery. As Nancy, Robin and the other Hawkins heroes investigate, they discover that Vecna is actually Henry Creel, the first child to make his way into the research facility under Dr. Brenner (Matthew Modine) where he was known as Number One (ten spots above Eleven). In California, Eleven struggles with bullies and the loss of her powers. She’s eventually taken to another military facility run by Dr. Owens (Paul Reiser) in an attempt to restore her powers. Here, through memory reconstruction, she recalls Henry Creel and her past with him, including his attack on the other children and her use of powers to banish him to the Upside Down.  Mike, Will, Jonathan and Jonathan’s new stoner buddy, Argyle (Eduardo Franco) go on a road-trip to track down Eleven after government agents attack the Byers residence. Meanwhile, in Russia, Hopper has somehow survived the blast at the end of Season 3 and is being held prisoner in a frigid gulag where he tries and fails to escape before Joyce and Murray (Brett Gelman) come to his rescue. They fight some Upside Down monsters to assist the others in their showdown against Vecna in the Upside Down. The series culminates in this final confrontation, with Eleven facing off against Vecna while the others are slowly strangled by supernatural vines and Max clings to life. Eddie is killed when he and Dustin enter the Upside Down, but ultimately everyone else escapes, though giant Upside Down rifts open in Hawkins (before shutting and then weirdly re-opening again). By the time we get to Season 5, the military has placed the entire city under lockdown. I thought Season 4 was mostly quite good, but I had some very real problems, especially with the final two episodes, which were a bit messy and way too long.  Here’s the official summary for Stranger Things Season 5: ""The fall of 1987. Hawkins is scarred by the opening of the Rifts, and our heroes are united by a single goal: find and kill Vecna. ""But, he has vanished – his whereabouts and plans unknown. Complicating their mission, the government has placed the town under military quarantine and intensified its hunt for Eleven, forcing her back into hiding. ""As the anniversary of Will’s disappearance approaches, so does a heavy, familiar dread. The final battle is looming – and with it, a darkness more powerful and more deadly than anything they’ve faced before. To end this nightmare, they’ll need everyone – the full party – standing together, one last time.""

The Walking Dead creator Frank Darabont will be directing one of the episodes. Newcomers to the cast include Linda Hamilton, Jake Connelly and Alex Breaux.

",,"ByZak Doffman, Contributor. This is wild and new. Attackers have worked out that malicious emails pushing links to adult sites will solicit plenty of clicks. Unfortunately, those clicks trigger a fake update that installs dangerous malware on your device. As tempting as it may be — do not click. The team at Acronis warn the “novel ‘JackFix’ attacks” combine “screen hijacking techniques with ClickFix, displaying a realistic, full-screen Windows Update of ‘Critical Windows Security Updates’ to trick victims into executing malicious commands.” We have seen plenty of seemingly innocuous lures to drive ClickFix attacks, most being fake captchas and technical support pop-ups. But this new campaign “leverages fake adult websites (xHamster, PornHub clones) as its phishing mechanism.” Acronis says “the adult theme, and possible connection to shady websites, add to a victim’s psychological pressure, making victims more likely to comply with sudden ‘security update’ installation instructions.” The attack itself hijacks a PC’s entire screen, “displaying an authentic looking Windows Update screen — complete with the appropriate animations, a counting-up percentage of progress and the appearance of going full screen.” The attack is executed entirely within the PC’s browser, and Acronis says the resulting screen hijacking “is something we haven’t seen done before this campaign, but the principle is well proven and goes back over 15 years.” The adult content is the new twist on a theme, enticing users to click before “the trap is sprung.” Psychologically, the lure is designed to catch you when you’re on edge, clicking something you know you probably shouldn’t. And so when an urgent security update screen opens, you’re more likely to be tricked into engaging.  Staying safe is easy. Don’t access adult sites from links in emails or messages or pop-ups. As with any other website, access it directly using the usual means."

A press briefing in Paris revealed further details.,,"ByJoshua Lamb, Contributor. Ubisoft has unveiled a new research and development project which utilises generative artificial intelligence technology to turn non-playable characters (NPCs) in video games into companions that players can interact with using their voice. At a press briefing in Paris, the French developer - which is best known for making the Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry games - provided details on the software, which it is currently calling “Teammates”, that will eventually be made available to developers to use in their games. “It will redefine how you interact with teammates. It allows you to lead a squad of intelligent, proactive NPCs through dynamic combat scenarios where your voice is your greatest tool”, said Ubisoft. Xavier Manzanares, Ubisoft’s director of generative AI gameplay, led the presentation which featured a gameplay prototype. It began with him conversing with an AI assistant called “Jaspar” - which is not unlike Apple’s “Siri” - through a headset. Jaspar was able to address Manzanares by name (although he used “Mark” instead of “Xavier” in the demonstration), answer questions on the game’s plot and objectives and provide a detailed overview on his in-game buddies, Pablo and Sophia who are robotic soldiers. “[Teammates] has an always accessible, voice-driven companion inside the game. It can answer questions anytime you want on anything” explained Manzanares. FEATURED | Frase ByForbes™ Unscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase Pinpoint By Linkedin Guess The Category Queens By Linkedin Crown Each Region Crossclimb By Linkedin Unlock A Trivia Ladder Aside from holding a conversation, Manzanares said that Jaspar can also change the in-game settings, alter user interface layouts and open menus in real-time without the player needing to pause the game.  He added that the assistant can also summarise pieces of lore found within the game and refresh a player’s memory on what has happened if it has been sometime since they last played. “That would be so cool in a game where the world is rich and you want to know more” Manzanares said. Further into the demonstration, Manzanares also spoke with Pablo and Sophia. The game was set in a futuristic dystopian world and he asked the pair to each stand on a pressure plate that would help him open a door, which they both did immediately. “It was really important for us to add orders in and for them to have an effect. Here, it was not scripted. Pablo and Sophia didn’t go because I said ‘door’ or ‘pressure plate’. They did it because they reasoned about what I said” he explained. Later in the demo, the trio ended up in a shootout with other soldiers. Manzanares issued his team with more complex instructions by holding “RB” down on an Xbox controller and speaking. This included telling Sophia to “back Pablo up” and to “flank to the right” of enemies. Work on Teammates began in 2024 when Ubisoft showcased a programme called “Neo NPCs” at the annual Game Developer’s Conference in March. According to Manzanares, earlier this year the team working on generative AI at the publisher went from 25 staff members to 80; between January and March, deeper development on Teammates began. “[Neo NPCs] was all about emotions, connections and systems around conversations” Manzanares said, adding that Teammates is more concerned with testing the AI’s reasoning, comprehension and awareness. “Going forward, we’ll fuse both together. It’s really important when it comes to relationships with NPCs in the future” he added. Testing on Teammates began on October 29 with 300 players, which were chosen by Ubisoft at random with no prior knowledge on their experience or gaming preferences. There is currently no timescale on when the general public will be able to play with the software. There are currently concerns amongst some video game developers that generative AI will cause job displacements and potentially impact a game’s overall quality, although these issues were not discussed in the presentation."

Digital Extremes has rolled out its latest pre-alpha milestone update for Soulframe, the studio’s upcoming fantasy action MMO and spiritual counterpart to the live service looter shooter, Warframe. The new Preludes 12 update adds a range of gameplay improvements, expands early combat options, and, most notably, officially launches the game’s Founders program, giving early supporters access to exclusive items, cosmetics, and instant entry to the ongoing pre-alpha.  This means you can buy your way into the game early now instead of needing to wait on an invite code. The update continues the iterative approach Digital Extremes has embraced for Soulframe’s development, with Preludes operating as a long-running pre-alpha meant to gather community feedback and shape the project ahead of a full release.  With today’s update, players can try out a new Greatsword grip type, take on newly added Agari sub-bosses, and explore a reworked onboarding experience meant to better guide first-time Envoys through Soulframe’s world. Improvements include clearer Fable tracking, easier access to traversal options, and the ability to test all three starting Pacts before committing to one. Digital Extremes is also introducing more structured progression features. New fauna-based Totems and Runes allow players to further specialize their combat style depending on weapon class, while Siege Encounters act as combat-focused side missions with escalating waves of enemies. A new vendor, Zenith—described as a “dale seer camel”—joins the Nightfold hub to offer goods and Founders-related items. FEATURED | Frase ByForbes™ Unscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase Pinpoint By Linkedin Guess The Category Queens By Linkedin Crown Each Region Crossclimb By Linkedin Unlock A Trivia Ladder The newly launched Founders program is the biggest addition. Digital Extremes is inviting players to choose one of four Founder paths, each tied to a “Wyld Pact” archetype: fighter, mage, archer, or a premium “Wyld Paragon” tier that bundles all three.  Founder packages include exclusive weapons, armor sets, dyes, cosmetics, Arcs (the game’s premium currency), invite codes for friends, and a crossover longsword skin for Warframe. Founders will also have the ability to “etch” their name into the Eternium Garden social hub through a unique planted Bloom. Physical merchandise, including shirts, pins, and art cards, is also available depending on the chosen path. ""Warframe would not still be going strong 12 years later without those who supported us at its early foundations,"" said creative director Geoff Crookes, in a prepared statement. “Soulframe Founders is us planting some of our biggest roots yet for the future. We’ve now reached the phase of development where we can welcome people in to help turn those roots into a solid foundation and build something we've all been waiting and hoping for from the ground up. We promise to continue serving this new community for as long as they allow us to, and to install the themes of redemption and hope throughout every aspect of Soulframe.” Soulframe still does not have a release date and is only announced for PC at this time, but since Warframe is on every platform at this point it’s safe to assume Soulframe will at least be coming to PlayStation and Xbox closer to full release. You can now wishlist the game on Steam."

",,"BySteve Forbes, Forbes Staff. Washington’s political class keeps insisting that our healthcare problems can be solved with more regulations, more dictates and more bureaucratic tinkering. The results of this command-and-control mindset speak for themselves: exploding premiums, shrinking choices and a healthcare system that’s increasingly unresponsive, unaccountable and unaffordable. We don’t need more government engineering; we need more freedom. When individuals, not bureaucrats, control healthcare dollars, innovation flourishes, costs come down and patients receive better care. This is the same formula that has made the U.S. the global leader in technology, finance and consumer products. There’s no reason healthcare should be any different. Here’s a blueprint for reform grounded in common sense and economic reality. • Empower Americans with True Universal Health Savings Accounts Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) embody a basic truth: When people spend their own money, they demand better value. But today’s HSAs are hedged in by restrictions that undermine their potential. There are ways to fix that: 1.      Make HSAs universal, available to everyone 2.      Raise or abolish contribution caps 3.      Allow HSA dollars to be used for a wide array of services, from telemedicine to mental health to preventive and wellness care 4.      Allow HSAs to be used to buy health insurance Put consumers in control, and providers will have to compete, just like every other industry that delivers quality and innovation. • Restore Reality to Health Insurance  One of the great absurdities in healthcare today is the attempt to pretend that everyone presents the same risks. That’s an economic fantasy and is driving premiums through the roof. Reform must allow: 1.   Wider age bands and sensible health ratings 2.   Premium discounts or HSA bonuses for healthy behavior Rewarding healthier choices lowers costs and improves outcomes. Only in Washington is that controversial. • Make Catastrophic Coverage the Foundation of Health Insurance Again Insurance was never meant to micromanage colds, routine checkups and basic prescriptions. No other form of insurance attempts this. We need: 1.   Affordable catastrophic plans that cover big, unexpected expenses 2.   The ability for these plans to compete across state lines 3.   The ability to use HSAs and direct payment for routine care This simple structure would instantly eliminate mountains of waste and administrative bloat. • Give Americans the flexibility they deserve, including access to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan Consumers should be able to tailor coverage like they tailor their investment portfolios—a catastrophic plan here, a direct-primary-care membership there, plus telehealth and chronic-care add-ons. One of the best reforms available is also one of the simplest: Open the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) program to everyone. For decades federal workers have enjoyed an abundance of private insurance choices competing for their business. It works. The rest of Americans deserves the same. This reform alone would create a national, transparent and competitive marketplace that empowers families instead of bureaucracies. • Demand Real Price Transparency Healthcare invoices that read like ancient cuneiform tablets must become relics of the past. The only way to drive down prices is to shine a light on them. We need: 1.  Bundled, upfront prices that itemize costs, such as the anesthesiologist  2. Strict enforcement of transparency rules 3.  Freedom for cash-based and subscription-based providers to compete openly When prices are visible, competition follows. When competition follows, costs decline. Every time. • A Safety Net That Elevates, Not Entraps Those who need help should receive it—but in a form that maximizes dignity and choice. Vouchers would give low-income Americans the ability to buy the same innovative private plans as anyone else. The bottom line is that our healthcare crisis is not the fault of markets; it’s the result of markets being strangled. Free up choice, empower consumers and unleash competition, and U.S. healthcare will become more affordable, more accessible and far more innovative. Freedom works. It’s time we let it work in healthcare."

",,"ByKarl Freund, Contributor. The AI sphere is abuzz lately with news and rumors that the latest Google TPU, Ironwood, is powering the Gemini3 model, outpacing OpenAI on many metrics including intelligence and performance. Now, The Information, echoed by Bloomberg and CNBC, is reporting that Alphabet’s Google is preparing to make its TPUs available beyond Google Cloud, with Meta Platforms as the lead design win. Google is also rumored to be pitching the Ironwood Pod to other hyperscalers and large enterprises as an Nvidia  alternative. Consequently, Alphabet is up nearly 50% over the last month, while Nvidia is down over 7%.  But another shoe is about to drop.  (Note that this story contains my analyst speculation.) Historically, TPUs have been confined to Google’s own fleet and exposed only as a managed service on Google Cloud. This barrier has limited TPUs to Google’s own workloads, primarily. But now, Google is rumored to be actively pitching on‑prem or colocation TPU deployments inside customers’ own facilities, including banks, HFT shops, and large cloud customers.  Given the specs on Ironwood, with 9216 TPUs in a Pod connected over optical fiber switched networks, is Google’s first TPU designed explicitly for the “age of inference.  Internal Google Cloud forecasts cited in press reports suggest Google management believes that broader TPU adoption could capture on the order of 10% of Nvidia’s current data‑center revenue run‑rate over time, which would imply tens of billions in prospective annual TPU revenue could be had, if the strategy rolls out. The current wet-concrete negotiations described in the press are between Google and Meta; there is no public indication that Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon.com, Inc. or Microsoft Azure (Microsoft Microsoft Corporation) are close to offering native TPU instances in their own clouds.  However, I did see one breadcrumb on the floor of SuperComputing last week in St. Louis. Cirrascale, a high-performance specialized cloud service provider, had the Google Cloud Logo on their booth.  While the staff was clear that nothing further could be shared without an NDA, I have to wonder if Cirrascale was planning to announce the deal with Google Cloud before a slight snag in timing occurred. Booth property already having been ordered and delivered, the image below suggests that they have a deal. Which begs the question, “Who else?” has such an arrangement and when might the news go live.  Meta’s interest is framed alongside other marquee external users. For example, Apple reportedly used large TPUv4/v5p clusters for training Apple Intelligence models via the Google Cloud.  Commentaries on the “AI chip wars” argue that multi‑cloud AI customers want a second source to Nvidia that is available at meaningful scale; TPU externalization plus Meta‑scale reference deployments are seen as Google’s attempt to become that second source, potentially shifting some AI capex away from Nvidia and potentially AMD toward Alphabet if Google’s silicon and software stack prove competitive. I would note that Google cannot currently match the Nvidia AI Ecosystem, nor its pervasive software stack. So, if my hunch is accurate, this should be seen as an inevitable evolution in the AI ecosystem and supply chain caused more by supply/demand imbalances rather than a competitive deficiency in Nvidia GPUs.

Pairing cutting-edge chemistry with artificial intelligence, a multidisciplinary team of scientists found fresh chemical evidence of Earth’s earliest life — concealed in 3.3-billion-year-old rocks — and molecular evidence that oxygen-producing photosynthesis was occurring over 800 million years earlier than previously documented. The oldest undisputed signs of life on Earth were found in 3.48-billion-year-old rocks from the Dresser Formation in Western Australia’s Pilbara region, where hot spring deposits preserved what many believe to be cell membranes. But this fossil site is a rare exception, as most of Earth’s earliest life left behind no visible traces. Until 500 million years ago, Earth was ruled by single-celled organisms and algae, with little tissue and no hard parts to fossilize. If by chance sedimentary rocks preserved faint traces of once living beings, in almost all cases the rocks were repeatedly crushed, heated, and fractured, further blurring or erasing any evidence left behind. A team of Carnegie researchers along with scientists from several partner universities and institutions, analyzed more than 400 samples, including ancient rocks, fossils, modern plants and animals, compiling a chemical database. This database was then used to train an AI to recognize chemical ‘fingerprints’ left behind by life. The AI detected chemical patterns linked to life in rocks as old as 3.3 billion years. Previously, no such traces had been found in rocks older than about 1.7 billion years. The AI also found molecular evidence that organisms used sunlight to metabolize carbon compounds at least 2.5 billion years ago. This finding extends the record of photosynthesis by over 800 million years. The researchers taught the AI to not focus on individual elements, but to look for chemical patterns. Carbon is a typical element found in life as we know it, but carbon compounds can be deposited in a sedimentary rock also by inorganic processes, for example during a volcanic eruption, or come from carbon-rich meteorites. But these sources show a random distribution, while living cells need and produce few kinds of molecules in high abundance.  “Our results show that ancient life leaves behind more than fossils; it leaves chemical ‘echoes.’ Using machine learning, we can now reliably interpret these echoes for the first time,” study coauthor Robert Hazen, a geochemist based at the Carnegie Institution’s Geophysical Laboratory and George Mason University, explains. The new method not only could help find signs of life in 4.2-billion-year-old rocks from Canada, suspected to hold some traces of ancient microorganisms, but also assist in the search for extraterrestrial life. If an AI can detect biotic echoes of terrestrial life billion of years old, the same technique might work on Martian rocks or even samples from Jupiter’s icy moon Europa, both worlds were — in theory — life once could have existed (and maybe even exists today). The full study, ""Organic geochemical evidence for life in Archean rocks identified by pyrolysis–GC–MS and supervised machine learnings,"" was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and can be found online here.

For two decades, the branded pharma website has been treated as the centerpiece of digital engagement. It has been the polished ‘front door’, where brands prepared to tell their story and hoped clinicians and patients would arrive to listen. Websites still get foot traffic, but they’ve become houses people notice as they pass by, not doors where they open, enter, and spend their precious time. Traffic still flows, but engagement is collapsing. Not because content teams aren’t working hard enough, and not because brand managers aren’t investing. The truth is more fundamental: the world no longer interacts with information in the way that pharma websites expect them to. Healthcare’s literacy problem is well documented. Only 12% of U.S. adults possess proficient health literacy, while nine in ten struggle to understand the health information they encounter, a statistic that has remained stubbornly unchanged across CDC and HHS assessments for many years. Physicians are far from immune: many report that branded HCP portals and even dedicated pharma apps are difficult to navigate and fail to surface clinically relevant information. The content isn’t the issue; the medium is. The pharma website is still built around linear navigation, dense text, and a user journey that presumes time, attention, and a willingness to hunt for answers. Real-world behavior shows the opposite. Behavior Has Changed But Technology Has Not Kept Pace Two major behavioral shifts define the current moment. According to Frank Defesche, senior vice president & general manager of life sciences for Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), ""pharma has spent decades pushing compliant, comprehensive content across brand sites and channels, but consumption habits have shifted. LLMs are now major consumers of that content, reshaping relevance and accessibility. Patients and providers no longer tolerate ‘scroll and read’ experience. Instead, they expect direct answers. With the right guardrails, AI can deliver contextual, on-demand information that aligns compliance with how people actually seek knowledge today. Without that shift, the right facts and the right voices will get lost in the noise.""  For consumers, AI-assisted health queries have moved mainstream. Among U.S. adults who search online for health-questions, roughly 30% say they often or always receive the answer they need from AI-generated responses. For clinicians, nearly two-thirds of physicians report using some form of AI in clinical practice, an 80% year-over-year jump, according to recent AMA data. Both groups have adopted a new expectation: ask and receive, not hunt and click. AI is no longer a novelty layered onto the healthcare system; it is becoming the operating mechanism underpinning it. Clinical AI pathways at Cedars-Sinai have handled tens of thousands of encounters. United Kingdom’s NHS deployed AI tools that dramatically accelerate stroke decision-making for tens of thousands of patients each year.  Information seeking has become universally and rapidly conversational and consumerized. Clinicians and patients are consumers, too, and they are passing static websites by as they navigate to more consumer-friendly locations. The Industry Keeps Maintaining Websites While Users Pass Them By Pharma maintains hundreds of sites across brands and markets, often investing millions annually to keep them compliant and current. Yet engagement metrics continue to decline. Despite this shift, pharma continues to justify brand.com investments in part because the sites provide key first-party data, offering brands a window into how clinicians and patients alike engage with their brand content. However, even when a website wanes, the data and insights it once produced need not vanish. Emerging, pharma-built AI engagement layers allow brands to collect compliant, high-fidelity interaction data from within the exact channels where clinicians and patients already spend their time, including email, SMS, social and, yes, even websites. Rather than ""driving"" users to a single channel in an attempt to understand their behavior, brands can offer higher quality engagement - that in turn yields higher quality data - by meeting the patients and providers that they serve where they already are. The reason is structural. Websites require users to come to them. Even traffic that is ‘driven’ to a website frequently requires a user to leave the channel they started in, be it television, social media, email, and enter an entirely new engagement channel. Personalized, in-flow content repeatedly outperforms generic site content, driving improvements in engagement. But most pharma sites cannot personalize meaningfully without breaking existing infrastructure constraints.  That’s why companies like Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) are taking a different path. “Healthcare is personal.  Lilly is focused on moving away from static, generic websites to transforming consumer insights into personalized content embedded in their daily 'life flow.’   In collaboration with our tech and data partners, AI is enabling us to upend the old approach and to help meet users where they already are, driving increased engagement and improved patient outcomes,” says Jennifer Oleksiw, global chief customer officer at Eli Lilly. Increasingly, AI is enabling pharma to upend the old approach, and to meet users where they already are. AI Is Rapidly Enabling a New Interface Layer The future of digital engagement will not take place on static websites. It will occur in the realization of a long-imagined omnichannel interface layer, powered by AI, that seamlessly marries scientific accuracy, regulatory compliance, personalization, channel orchestration, and user intent AI is collapsing what once required multiple, separate, complex, and expensive technology stacks such as CRM, content engines, analytics, and UX. What has emerged in its place is a single, integrated system capable of delivering compliant, context-specific answers instantly, and helping brands quickly and compliantly adapt to the changing needs and engagement preferences of their users. Global investment reflects this shift: the AI-in-healthcare market is estimated at $26.6 billion today, and is projected to surpass $180 billion by 2030. This is not innovation theater. It is not small-scale pilots. It is enterprise-wide infrastructure investment in an entirely new modality of engagement between brands and the clinicians and patients they serve. However, general purpose and consumer-favored generative AI tools cannot simply be slapped on top of existing pharma brand sites and be expected to deliver on this promise. Regulatory constraints, including strict regulatory review and submission requirements, demand a new architecture that combines the AI-powered experience users demand with the regulatory-led precision pharma requires. In other words, AI must be able to deliver exactly what consumers want, when they want it, while simultaneously only delivering exactly what pharma regulatory teams have approved, in the form it was approved. This constraint is not an obstacle. It is an opportunity. It is the reason the interface layer must be intentionally and thoughtfully built, and done so through the collaboration of technology and industry leaders. The Opportunity for Pharma Let’s make no mistake: whomever owns the interface layer will own the relationship that clinicians and patients have with the life-saving treatments and products they use. And this is a clear and present danger for today’s pharma companies.  According to Arpa Garay, former chief commercial officer at Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA) and former chief marketing officer at Merck (NYSE: MRK), ""the next competitive battleground isn’t reach or channel expansion, it’s whether our science shows up precisely when and where questions are asked. As AI becomes the first point of interpretation for patients and providers, the  brands that win will be the ones whose data, evidence, and value propositions are instantly accessible and contextually accurate. This shift isn’t optional. It’s central to how commercial teams will earn trust and relevance in the years ahead.” Consumer tech companies are already deploying medical-grade agents capable of triaging questions, surfacing recommendations, and shaping clinical decisions. And patients and providers alike are using them at increasing rates, asking and answering questions without ever reaching a pharma website. Health systems are likewise building their own AI-powered engagement layers, bring conversational support directly to patients and enabling more and deeper provider interactions.  Pharma’s own digital front doors, the pricey brand.com websites, are at increasing risk of becoming an afterthought. The next phase of digital health will belong to organizations that recognize and embrace this shift. For pharma to keep pace, and to take its rightful and important place in the conversations patients and providers are having about its treatments, this means recognizing two fundamental truths: With pharma supplying the trusted content, and technology partners providing a compliant integration layer, the result is not just a new coat of paint on the front door that patients and providers have stopped looking for. It is an opportunity to insert pharma directly into the spaces where those same patients and providers are conversing, and to ensure that those conversations are backed by top tier science and regulatory compliance.  The future of digital engagement will not be defined by assets, pages, or campaigns. It will be defined by who controls the intelligent layer that connects the right information to the right user at the right moment, regardless of channel. That requires deep, bidirectional collaboration between pharma organizations, AI-native health technology companies, and large infrastructure providers. No single party can deliver this alone. The ecosystem is too fractured, the data requirements too complex, and the compliance demands too unforgiving. A New Metric: Relevance, Not Traffic For years, digital success was measured by visits, clicks, dwell time, and bounce rates. Those metrics belong to the era of static websites. In an AI-first environment, the defining question becomes: Did the user receive the right, compliant answer at the exact moment they needed it? If a cardiologist can ask a complex, label-bound question through an embedded, approved agent, and receive a precise, context-aware response instantly, and is able to quickly proceed with the care of her patient, then why should any of us care about the channel through which that cardiologist received her answer?  Driving traffic to a static website is not the purpose; it never was. The brand.com website is simply one channel among many that exist for a purpose that has never been more important: to provide clear, accessible, and accurate information to patients and providers so that they can move forward confidently in their healthcare journey and receive the care into which pharma companies invest so much to bring to life. Engagement, not activity, is the point. Leading commercial organizations are already reframing their approach, including Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), which has been pushing its teams to think less about clicks and more about whether their science shows up when and where it’s needed most. As Murdo Gordon, executive vice president, global commercial operations at Amgen, puts it: “AI is collapsing the distance between a question and its answer. For commercial teams, that means our focus must shift from driving people to assets to ensuring our science shows up, accurately and instantly, wherever the question is asked. That’s the future of engagement and it will reshape how we measure success.” The Website Isn’t Dying, It’s Being Superseded The decline of the static pharma website is not a failure. It is the natural progression of an industry shifting from narrower, specific channels designed for one-way communication to a broader, context-aware, and conversational form of engagement. The brands that lead the next decade will not be the ones with the best websites or the largest search budgets. They will be the ones that break free from the cycle of repainting their brand.com front doors and venture out boldly into the new AI-powered world in which their patients and providers are already immersed. They will be the ones that partner with pharma-first technology companies to enable the intelligent, compliant, omnichannel layer that replaces the website entirely, the layer that meets clinicians and patients where they already are.

For seven years during the 1980s, bioluminescent jellyfish replaced lightbulbs in a little town in Devonshire, England. The incandescent creatures hung from streetlamps and illuminated the pages of books as residents read in bed before falling asleep. It was a magical time in Latchford: The light was soft and constant, the crime rate fell and tourists flocked to “the glowing village.”  In his new book Another England, London-born conceptual artist Phillip Toledano presents otherworldly images of this unusual phenomenon. The thing is, it never happened. Nor did the other wild apocryphal scenarios he concocts using AI to reimagine England in the 1980s — the miniature ice age that turned country cows and cottages into giant frozen blocks, for example, or the flower show that caused a “floral mutation outbreak,” replacing villagers’ heads with hydrangea clusters and sprouting leaves on their necks.    Toledano didn’t reinvent England’s landscapes solely as an exercise in creative whimsy. With Another England, he wants to underscore the idea that our long relationship with the photograph as a vessel of truth is eroding as artificial intelligence makes it simple to produce increasingly realistic fake images that can easily be mistaken for fact, sometimes with serious consequences. In his view, the notion of being able to trust that photos represent reality is dead.  “Because AI exists, everything is true and nothing is true simultaneously,” Toledano said in an interview from New York, where he has lived for more than 30 years. “There’s this incredibly powerful technology that can invent history on the fly.” FEATURED | Frase ByForbes™ Unscramble The Anagram To Reveal The Phrase Pinpoint By Linkedin Guess The Category Queens By Linkedin Crown Each Region Crossclimb By Linkedin Unlock A Trivia Ladder Toledano worked as an advertising art director for a decade before returning to his true passion, photography, and his pictures have appeared in publications including Esquire, GQ, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair. About four years ago, he began experimenting with AI image generators, mainly Midjourney, which he used to create the absurdist images in Another England, pairing the visuals with stories of his own invention.  In describing his creative process, he echoes other artists who view their collaboration with AI as a team effort between human and algorithm.   “AI is about honing and whittling, so an image will take anywhere from a couple of days to a week or two before I’m really, really happy with it,” said Toledano, who gives AI an author credit. “Images and words by Phillip Toledano and AI,” reads a introduction to the 64-page book.   In it, AI’s surreal imprint is easy to spot in images of a scarecrow wielding a lawnmower, a fox standing upright atop a burning car and a highway slicing Stonehenge in two. Even so, the visuals have an almost quaint charm.   “This book is a very nostalgic effort to recreate an England that I grew up in in the 1980s, kind of an echo of a memory,” Toledano said. “But the unifying idea is this idea of reinvented history. We live in this kind of liminal state where we're never really quite sure: Is this real? Is this not real?”   Such musings get at serious questions about our era of disinformation and digital deception, though many of the images in the book are humorous, as is the fake history they conjure. In one historical tall tale, the English Tourist Authority placed inflatable wildlife throughout the countryside so visitors could get perfect vacation photos without having to deal with uncooperative wildlife. Another fabrication veers into science fiction territory: A Cambridge start-up offered “selective mammalian merging” that allowed people to embody their pets’ traits simply by submitting a DNA sample. Suddenly, women are wandering the countryside, part human, part fluffy canine.  “I’m English and you know how hilarious English people are,” Toldeno joked of the absurdity running through the book.  Another England marks the second installment in Toledano’s historical surrealism series. Another America, from 2023, reimagined New York City of the 1940s and 1950s, complete with Zeppelins hovering between skyscrapers, women with smoke and fire rising from their heads and men buried up to their shoulders in showdrifts.  The books publish as AI continues to deeply divide the creative world. Some artists, Toledano among them, are excited about its potential to steer them in bold new directions. Others worry about their work being used to train AI datasets without credit or compensation. They fear it will impact their livelihoods, and even alter creativity itself.   It’s unsurprising, then, that Toledano has encountered pushback to his AI work, with comments like “AI slop,” “utter drivel” and “desolate stuff” appearing on his Instagram posts. “As Vince Gilligan said, ‘AI is the world's most expensive and energy-intensive plagiarism machine,"" U.K. portrait photographer Harry Borden wrote in response to one of them.   But others, like New York creative director Eric Lau, praise the work. “Love it,” Lau wrote. “Great PoV and love that you are pushing new boundaries.” Wrote photographer Amy Selwyn, “Looks fantastic.”  For Toledano, that mix of criticism and enthusiasm only reinforces what draws him to the medium in the first place. “AI is the ultimate blank sheet of paper, and that’s incredibly exciting,” he said. “It will go as far as you want to go. It’s boundless. It’s limitless.” "

Not every post on social media is worth repeating. The platform is known as the place to air our dirty laundry and poke holes in established arguments. Yet, there’s a way to increase the intelligence quota one post at a time. The following books are my top picks for fall that are quotable on social media, mostly because they have so many juicy factoids.   This book about a shipwreck that led to cannibalism is part adventure story and part legal review. The horrific true story of the Mignonette covers what Publisher’s Weekly called the most important murder trial in history which raised questions still relevant today. For someone like me who lives within a few hours of Lake Superior, the Gales of November hits close to home. The wreck happened in 1975 and is famous because of the song by Gordon Lightfoot. Waves rose as high as 55-60 feet on that fateful day in November.  Jill Lepore does a deep dive into how the U.S. Constitution formed and what it means for our modern era of politics. What makes this one a great pick for quoting on social media is that she is highly opinionated about how amendments can help us stay current as a nation. This exceptionally well-researched book is full of salient details about a dark chapter in history. The Zorg recounts the horrific story about a ship caught in a storm and the eventual murder of 130 enslaved Africans which led to the abolitionist movement in England.  Written by the founder of Hobby Lobby, this highly quotable book tackles the subject of leaving a legacy and how every family should have a mission statement. A social media post could cover the book and your own family mission statement.  Clocking in at 1,344 pages, the book Capitalism by Sven Beckert is a seminal work that explains how capitalism started, evolved, and expanded over the last several hundred years. It’s quotable because the details are so rich and interesting, especially how capitalism started with merchants in a little known area called Aden. I’ve written many times about the battle over TikTok, but this book provides much greater detail. It’s a twisty tale of how the TikTok algorithm evolved and the fight to keep it alive. My favorite sections detail out all of the business maneuvering to keep TikTok running including some surprising investors. In his book Gradually, Then Suddenly, author and pastor Mark Batterson explains how breakthroughs happen. It’s not usually a major viral event that happens out of the blue, but involves toil and labor over a long period of time. Batterson also makes the point that sometimes the breakthrough will happen generations after you do the toiling. One of my favorite authors who is filling a void ever since Bill Bryson retired, Simon Winchester’s ode to wind is full of quotable facts and details. He explains why there are only a handful of jet streams circulating the planet and what wind means for shipping. He also explains what might happen if the wind started to die down."
https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2025/11/25/is-your-business-ai-mature/,Is Your Business AI-Mature?,"AI maturity is a big factor in business in the age of agentic AI. 

",,"ByJohn Werner, Contributor. Sometimes, as business leaders forge ahead with AI, it might feel like walking through a blizzard, the wind tearing at you, snow lashing your face, your clothes flapping and your nose getting chafed and red… Or maybe that’s just a trite metaphor. Either way, there are some essential challenges to working through the big questions that leadership teams have to ask in the agentic AI era. Business is so different now, in so many ways, and the technology is there, waiting to be used. In this context, experts have started to use the term “AI maturity” to refer to companies that have established road maps for AI usage. Alternately, they can use this term to talk about “baby steps” toward fuller adoption, or brainstorming on how AI can enhance business processes. One of the most common ways to talk about and assess AI maturity is in the use of major “stages” – often, a model will use four of these to identify the way stations to the destination. For instance, this resource from MIT/Sloan identifies stage 1 as “experiment and prepare,” stage 2 as “build pilots and capabilities, stage 3 as “develop AI ways of working,” and stage 4 as “become AI future-ready.” By contrast, this version from ChatGPT gives us these stages: beginners, implementers, accelerators, pacesetters. This latter set actually comes from a company called ServiceNow, which has written an in-depth report on AI maturity, how it works, and at what rate business is adopting the right approaches. I actually saw Brian Solis of ServiceNow present on this at a recent Stanford event, and he broke down some of the numbers in the report. For instance, in relation to building businesses powered by AI, 94% of CEOs said that they were not satisfied with their current AI investments. Yet, Solis pointed out, when you talk to CEOs about their AI vision, a full 90% will say that they are operating with a strategy, while only 57% of their employees agree. “73% of CEOs say that that (their) AI strategy is highly strategic and even visionary, but only 47% of their employees agree with that,” he added. So, as Solis noted, there’s a “disconnect” in thinking about the average company’s use of AI. Presumably, the chance for this discrepancy goes down as the business invests in more brainstorming, cross-department conversations, and integration at all levels. “AI can do more than make yesterday faster, cheaper, more efficient, and more scalable,” he said. “It can also unlock new opportunities. So the risk for leaders is not thinking too big, it's actually thinking too small.” That’s in the context of Solis’ work advising companies looking for a path. “The question I like to ask the companies that I'm working with is, are you using AI to improve the past, or are you using AI to invent the future,” he added, “and those are two questions that should be asked at the beginning of every investment, every plan, every strategy, every roadmap.” In making AI maturity assessment more concrete, ServiceNow looks at how to observe AI maturity in terms of gross revenue, infrastructure, training and more, and identifies what it takes to be a “pacesetter” or a company out in front of the AI revolution. “Becoming an AI-first business means redesigning workflows so that intelligence flows seamlessly and enhances every operation,” study authors write. “It means piloting next generation AI solutions and exploring new possibilities to create value. It means envisioning future opportunities to augment human intelligence within the enterprise, and adopting an intelligent, connected platform that connects data, people, and processes.” Solis also appears in the report, in the section on “humanizing” AI, with three principle recommendations: prioritize augmentation over replacement, use AI as a catalyst for human potential, and adopt an AI-first mindset. He also mentioned, in his lecture on this, the value of removing siloes for data. Here’s more from the report text on the siloing of data in systems, and how AI maturity can help: “Pacesetters recognize the power of knocking down silos to allow data to flow between business functions, enabling every team to draw on a central repository of information. They harness AI-powered digital workflows to connect people, data, and processes across the enterprise. As a result, 56% of Pacesetters have made significant progress connecting data and operational silos, compared to 41% of others. By taking this approach, Pacesetters can translate AI insights into concrete business outcomes.” So to figure out where your firm is on this trajectory, ask yourself: do leaders have a defined AI strategy? Is it based on actionable information about existing business processes? Does it work? And is everyone on board? Those are some of the fundamental questions in applying your own analysis to AI maturity. As much as a lot of expert opinion is swirling around in the blogosphere and elsewhere on the net, the whole thing comes down to people and processes. So take time to consider where your business is at this point, and how to get where you want to be. "

",,"ByMark Sparrow, Senior Contributor. Campfire Audio is probably best known for producing some of the best high-end earphones, or in-ear monitors as they are often called, beyond a certain price point. Now the Portland-based boutique manufacturer of IEMs has announced the launch of Iris, a new hybrid design of IEM that has Campfire’s signature sound but at a more affordable price.  While some of Campfire’s IEMs sell for thousands of dollars, the new Iris model comes in at a much more affordable price of $349. And the launch is just in time for the holiday season. Campfire Audio says that its new Iris IEM brings powerful performance, elegant design and everyday durability for music lovers seeking an accessible entry into high-fidelity audio. The new Iris IEMs are built for listeners looking for high-quality sound with the minimum of fuss. They are aimed at newcomers who want to dip their toes into the hi-fi world for the first time.  These IEMs are also likely to appeal to longtime fans of Campfire Audio products who are looking for a pair of IEMs that are more rugged for daily travel. They will suit anyone searching for a premium-feeling gift that doesn’t require any audiophile expertise to enjoy. “With Iris, we wanted to capture the spirit of Campfire in its simplest, most approachable form,” says Ken Ball, founder of Campfire Audio. “It’s a joyful, easygoing IEM. Something that feels instantly familiar yet still delivers that signature clarity and character people expect from us.” Inside the Iris IEMs are Campfire’s custom 10mm ADLC dynamic drivers, paired with a dedicated balanced armature for that provides a crisp treble reproduction. This hybrid system produces a warm sound that’s easy to listen to thanks to a design that balances clarity with musicality. Campfire Audio describes the sound as  “instantly welcoming.” Each of the Iris housings is a fully transparent 3D-printed shell that lets listeners take a peek at the precise engineering contained within. The earpieces have stainless-steel accents that add visual structure and durability to the design.  Compact, featherlight, and comfortable for long listening sessions, the Iris IEMs are intentionally designed to be taken anywhere and sit just above Campfire’s Axion model. Iris offers a higher-performance entry into Campfire’s lineup before stepping into the brand’s upper-tier audiophile models, including the excellent Clara IEMs designed by Alessandro Cortini of Nine Inch Nails fame. The Iris IEMs are available now from Campfire Audio and are priced at $349. "

Talking bears. Terrifying aliens. Adorable aliens. Kids on wild adventures for buried treasure, and commandos out hunting Nazis in occupied France. There are so many great movies about to leave Netflix at the end of November. It would be a shame not to add at least a couple to your watchlist this week. Thanksgiving is almost here, so a lot of the following list is a little more family-friendly, though I include a couple for older audiences as well. I figure a lot of people will be spending time with their kids or grandkids, so a few of these are aimed at a wider audience. But don’t worry, each of them is great for all ages (and we should all strive to remain young at heart). Each of the following movies departs Netflix on December 1st, so you have exactly one week to check these off your list. Be sure to also check out my TV streaming guide for Thanksgiving week. There are so many great shows out at the moment, from Pluribus to The Chair Company to The Mighty Nein – it’s hard to keep up! For new TV shows and movies, take a gander at my latest weekend streaming guide as well. Okay, onto the list! “Come find me when you wake up!” Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt star in this action-packed sci-fi flick that somehow manages to be the lovechild of Starship Troopers and Groundhog Day. The 91% Rotten Tomatoes movie is from director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity) and is adapted from the popular Japanese light novel, All You Need Is Kill. I haven’t seen this one since it came out, but it’s a really entertaining movie with a great supporting cast that includes Bill Paxton and Brendan Gleeson among others.  “Be good.” I place E.T. in my top 5 Steven Spielberg movies and honestly it probably makes my top 5 kids movies as well. That’s true of a lot of people: The film has a 99% Rotten Tomatoes score, though surprisingly only a 72% audience score. Curiouser and curiouser. The story of Elliot (Henry Thomas), Gertie (Drew Barrymore) and the little lost alien who they discover stranded near their home is genuinely one of the best American family films of all time. This is another one I haven’t seen in years, and I’m sorely tempted to watch it myself this week. “Oooh, that's a bingo!” Quentin Tarantino entered something of a new phase of filmmaking with his 2009 revisionist World War 2 movie, Inglourious Basterds, which I think gets better with every viewing. Christoph Waltz’s villainous Hans Landa, the notorious “Jew-hunter,""  quickly became one of the best bad guys of the 2000’s and Waltz became a household name. Brad Pitt, Eli Roth, Diane Kruger, Michael Fassbender, Melanie Laurent and more round out the excellent cast. “Down here, it's our time. It's our time down here.” It’s kind of wild that two of my favorite childhood films are leaving Netflix this week. E.T. and The Goonies disappear from the streaming service on the same day – though I should point out: Goonies never say die. Richard Donner’s coming-of-age movie really helped define the genre and the decade. It’s a great adventure about a group of kids who find themselves in way over their heads, achieving the impossible to save their families from eviction. A true underdog story with a palpable sense of magic. I actually had the great fortune of interviewing Sean Astin (who plays Mikey) recently which was really neat. The Goonies only has a 77% Rotten Tomatoes score, but critics were harsher toward family movies back then. 91% of audience members give it a thumbs-up (the other 9% probably hate kittens). “This family needed that wee bear every bit as much as he needed you.” While I’m always telling everyone that Paddington 2 is an absolute masterpiece and one of the greatest movies ever made, it’s worth noting that the first Paddington is also a charming adventure that’s very much worth watching. You certainly don’t have to watch it before Paddington 2, but you might as well! Actually, watch it this week because Paddington 2 isn’t leaving yet, but this one is. Paddington’s Rotten Tomatoes score is just three percentage points shy of the sequel, at 96%. (Some book purists do not like these movies at all). “The greedy beat the needy, Willy. It's just the way of the world.” Speaking of Paddington, 2023’s Wonka is from the same writer-director team that made Paddington 2, which is a real mark in its favor. Yes, I know, Timothee Chalamet is in everything these days – like Pedro Pascal, he’s been over-cast and familiarity breeds contempt – but that’s no reason to miss this Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory prequel. Paddington 2’s very own Hugh Grant also stars (in a very different role). The film has an 82% on Rotten Tomatoes. “You two are the dumbest bounty hunters I have ever seen! You couldn't even deliver a bottle of milk!” Another classic ‘80s movie, Midnight Run is the story of a bounty hunter tracking down – and then trying to keep hold of – a white collar criminal on the run from both the feds and the criminals trying to kill him. Robert De Niro plays bounty hunter, Jack Walsh, and Charles Grodin plays the man he’s sent to find, Jonathan Mardukas. The comedy thriller has a 95% on Rotten Tomatoes and is one of my favorite '80s odd couple flicks, right up there with Planes, Trains and Automobiles and Throw Mama from the Train.

Samsung’s cheapest Black Friday Galaxy S25 Ultra price remains the sub-$850 offer the Korean company launched last week. It didn’t last long, because Samsung has now raised its Galaxy S25 Ultra price days before Black Friday, but it has added some new promotions to offset that increase. While you will pay more to pick up the Galaxy S25 Ultra from Samsung.com in today’s updated Black Friday offer, you will also get more storage for your money, alongside improved trade-in prices. If you’re squarely interested in the cheapest price rather than more storage, subscribe to my newsletter for instant deal updates so you don’t miss out. Don’t forget to read about Samsung’s “Price Promise” if you plan to buy a Galaxy phone this Black Friday.  Update November 25th 12:40pm ET: The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is also on the receiving end of a similar deal to the Galaxy S25 Ultra Black Friday offer detailed below. Samsung has brought back its cheapest Galaxy Z Fold 7 price at $1,399.99, which it first debuted a couple of weeks ago.  The difference this time is that the foldable phone now comes with an extra 256GB of storage for that price. So, the least amount of storage you can buy, for the Galaxy Z Fold 7’s lowest ever price, is 512GB. Samsung.com has also knocked $600 off the Fold 7 if no phone is traded in. With the storage upgrade, the offer represents a $720 discount for the Galaxy Z Fold 7. This is comfortably the best deal the foldable phone has seen since it launched, and if you were planning to buy it, now is the time. I would recommend taking the $600 discount instead of trading your used phone in, and selling it on eBay or Swappa instead. But if you do take the trade-in route, Samsung has brought back some of its best trade-in prices after they took a nosedive earlier this month. For example, the Korean company will pay a very respectable $600 for the Galaxy S23 Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 4. However, it’s still slim pickings for owners of older phones, such as the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which is only valued at $200. The $849 Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra 256GB deal is gone. It may come back again before Christmas, but for now, Samsung has altered its deals and raised the flagship’s price to $914 for the 512GB storage option. The new Galaxy S25 Ultra price is part of a double storage deal, worth $240, alongside a further $385 off if no phone is traded in. That brings the price down to $914.99 from $1,419.99.  If you’re happy to stretch, the 1TB storage option is only $120 more (down to $1,034.99 from $1,659.99). While the low base price has disappeared, this is the cheapest I have seen the Galaxy S25 Ultra 1TB model, which also makes it cheaper than the regular price of the 256GB model. Here’s the good news: Samsung’s trade-in prices have also risen significantly. For the last couple of weeks, they were oddly low, rivaling Amazon’s poor used-phone valuations. Perhaps that was part of a Black Friday strategy to make the deal look better. Either way, prices (for select phones) are back up to some of their best. For example, Samsung would only pay $170 for the Galaxy S22 Ultra last week. That has now gone up to $480, just $20 less than what Samsung paid for it in June.  The Galaxy S23 Ultra is now valued at $530, which is $50 less than June’s price. Other decent trade-in prices include $450 for the Galaxy S23 Plus and $480 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4. Samsung is squarely focused on price drops for this Black Friday. The company has slashed prices for its Galaxy Z Fold 7, Galaxy S25 Edge, and Galaxy S25 Ultra to the lowest I have seen for each model since they launched. This comes at the expense of free hardware, which in the past has meant free laptops, Galaxy Watches, Galaxy Buds, and free tablets. As it stands, Samsung has bundled the below software freebies with the Galaxy S25 Ultra: The headline Galaxy S25 Ultra freebie here is the six months of Google AI Pro, with the Adobe Lightroom and SiriusXM offers not far behind. But the lack of free hardware, or even longer software freebies such as a year of Disney Plus (a 2023 Samsung freebie), makes the offering fairly tame."
https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2025/11/25/how-to-buy-spacex-stock-in-2026/,How To Buy SpaceX Stock In 2026,"How to invest in SpaceX while it remains private, including exposure through public–private crossover ETFs, mutual funds, closed-end funds, and secondary markets.",,"ByJoel Shulman, Contributor. As SpaceX expands into a critical layer of global infrastructure, powering orbital launch, Starlink broadband, climate and scientific missions, geospatial intelligence, and national-security logistics, investor interest has intensified, prompting many to ask how to buy SpaceX stock or gain exposure to the company’s growth despite its private status. SpaceX has no public ticker, and retail investors cannot purchase shares directly on any U.S. exchange. Access today is limited to a small group of public funds that hold SpaceX privately or to accredited-only secondary markets. Among public vehicles, public–private crossover ETFs offer one of the more accessible paths to indirect exposure, with XOVR appearing as a fund that reports a SpaceX position. Additional exposure, typically in smaller sizes, is available through select mutual funds, certain closed-end structures, and private-market vehicles designed for accredited investors. Because SpaceX is private and has no publicly traded shares, investor access occurs only through funds that hold SpaceX positions within private structures. Among public vehicles, public–private crossover ETFs currently represent one of the more accessible categories; within this group, XOVR is the only U.S.-listed ETF that reports a SpaceX position in its filings. Additional exposure exists through open-end mutual funds such as BPTRX and BFGFX, the closed-end fund DXYZ, and through secondary-market transactions available solely to accredited investors. Why SpaceX Is the Most Sought-After Private Company Elon Musk has founded companies that dominate global attention, but SpaceX is the one reshaping real-world infrastructure. With record launch cadence, an expanding satellite constellation, and deepening partnerships across defense, aviation, scientific agencies, and telecommunications, SpaceX has become one of the world’s most strategically important private companies. Its advantage stems from engineering breakthroughs, vertical integration, cost leadership, and the ability to attract elite technical talent. A Launch Engine Without Equal SpaceX closes 2025 targeting roughly 165–170 orbital launches, extending its lead as the most active launch provider in history. This frequency creates a compounding strategic advantage: Starlink: SpaceX’s Transformational Asset While rockets define SpaceX’s brand, Starlink is its most scalable commercial platform. The network now provides broadband to: The next phase, direct-to-cell connectivity with telecom partners, positions Starlink as a potential global communications backbone. Science, Climate, and Defense Missions Add Durability SpaceX now launches sophisticated climate-monitoring, Earth-observation, and scientific satellites for U.S. and international agencies. These multiyear missions embed the company into national and allied infrastructure, providing stable revenue uncharacteristic of rapidly scaling private companies. Starship: The Industrial Breakthrough Starship, the fully reusable super-heavy system, is designed to reshape: If Starship reaches full reuse at scale, orbital transport costs could drop dramatically, unlocking new commercial and scientific opportunities. Can You Buy SpaceX Stock? How Retail Investors Can Get SpaceX Exposure in 2026 Since SpaceX shares are not publicly listed, exposure comes through public funds holding private-company stakes or through private secondary transactions available only to accredited investors. 1) Public–Private Crossover ETFs Public–private crossover ETFs invest across late-stage private companies and public-market innovators within a regulated, exchange-traded structure. They generally offer daily liquidity with NAV-based pricing and lower fees than other vehicles providing access to private holdings. In this category, XOVR is currently the only U.S.-listed ETF that reports a SpaceX exposure, according to public filings. Exposure levels may change over time as funds update their disclosures. 2) Open-End Mutual Funds Holding SpaceX Baron Partners Fund (BPTRX) - Long-time SpaceX holder; higher fees consistent with active management. Baron Focused Growth Fund (BFGFX/BFGIX) - Also holds SpaceX, generally at lower fees than BPTRX. 3) Closed-End Funds (Premium Risk) Destiny Tech100 (DXYZ) - A closed-end fund including private technology holdings. Shares can trade at significant premiums or discounts to NAV. 4) Interval / Venture-Style Funds Some interval funds invest in late-stage private companies including SpaceX. They offer quarterly liquidity, higher fees, and less frequent valuation updates. 5) Accredited-Only Secondary Markets Accredited investors may occasionally purchase SpaceX shares through private secondary platforms. These involve: Investment Outlook SpaceX anchors global launch, satellite communications, national-security logistics, and emerging off-planet infrastructure. Because the company remains private, public–private crossover funds offer the most accessible pathway for retail investors seeking indirect exposure, with mutual funds, closed-end funds, and private-market vehicles providing additional, but often more constrained, alternatives. Evaluating these structures requires understanding differences in liquidity, fees, valuation practices, and the potential for premiums or discounts relative to NAV. ----------------------------------------- Disclosure: Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevetengler/2025/11/25/auto-software-recalls-approach-record-for-6th-straight-year/,Auto Software Recalls Approach Record For 6th Straight Year,"Software recalls have plagued the entire industry for the past few years, but some manufacturers have had greater issues with rigor and safety.",,"BySteve Tengler, Senior Contributor. For possibly a record sixth straight year, the number of software recalls will rise past last year’s record for futility. So far in 2025, 166 recalls have affected a variety of automakers. Looking at 2024-2025 together, Tesla has affected the most vehicles (5,777,605), Ford has the greatest number of recall actions (73), and Stellantis suffers from the highest cost per vehicle sold ($743.22) resulting from the software recalls. “We are watching a pivotal moment in history,” asserts Todd Warren, an adjunct professor of Computer Science at Northwestern University who tracks the NHTSA-reported software recalls on a website along with various statistics including percentage of over-the-air fixes by manufacturer. “Automakers will either fold under the weight of their own technical debt or emerge with a significant, competitive edge given better quality and methods of dealing with issues in the field.” That competitive chasm might be even more astonishing than the rising numbers of recalls. In a recent article by WIRED entitled “Why Are Car Software Updates Still So Bad,” Carlton Reid suggests the average cost of a recall is $500 and, per Harman Automotive, an over-the-air reflashing of software costs $66.50 per vehicle. Applying those costs to each manufacturer and their varying ability to fix their safety concerns over the air for 2024-2025 saves Telsa billions of dollars. Meanwhile, Ford has the highest overall costs exceeding $2.5B with Stellantis just slightly behind at $1.8B. Comparing those egregious costs to their instate rival, General Motors ($443k over 2024-2025), Ford has a $1B per year disadvantage given just the software recall costs, and each Stellantis vehicle sold has a $661 burden over each GM vehicle. These staggering numbers, however, ignore correlated warranty bills, customer dissatisfaction impacts, and punitive jury damages like the recent $200 million judgement against Tesla. The multivariate equation of contributing causes and associated impacts is incredibly complex and beyond even any analyst or consultant despite the claims by some. It’s worth detailing the underlying themes of root causes to understand possible ways forward. In the same WIRED article, the author quotes McKinsey that “… since 2021 the complexity of the latest software platforms has increased by about 40 percent per year.” In part, the pressure to add new technology is forcing this with nearly half (48%) of car buyers prioritizing in-vehicle technology over brand or styling and China’s 49.9% year-over-year increase in the installation of Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). To remain stagnant is to fall behind globally. Traditional automotive development from the likes of Detroit and Munich have emphasized deep, intentional engineering rigor. Several major consultancies opined about the “talent gap” between Silicon Valley and the auto industry causing several OEMs to attempt the quick fix of injecting “fail fast” methodologies utilized for websites and apps. The strong problem: neither culture understood the necessary elements of each other’s ways of working and how to integrate the required quality aspects with the necessary speed elements. As stated well by Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at UC Berkeley, “Silicon Valley isn’t the future, Detroit isn’t the past. They’re both part of the winning strategy going forward.” According to Planview, over 20% of developmental budgets that were dedicated to new products are “… redirected to address tech debt issues,” which is the accrued cost of legacy code awaiting completion, updates, or corrections. In other words, teams want to go win the next competition but have injuries or unmet obligations from the last game. For corporations that have built vehicles since the dawn of software with an average of approximately 2,000 semiconductor chips per vehicle and possible 30 or more platforms, that historical burden can significantly weigh on strategic plans. Amongst my five predictions at the beginning of 2025 was that recalls costs would double, and either Ford or GM would be acquired since they both were lacking the fundamental elements and economic advantages to “… proceed without help” in a costly set of unrealized gambles (e.g., autonomy, Electric Vehicles, Ford’s infamous FNV4 architecture). Although neither prediction has become perfectly true, the trends suggest I wasn’t perfectly wrong either such that minimally Ford needs some aggressive course corrections to avoid this fate. Sometimes I hate being right."

Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing have equipped clinicians with insights into our bodies that are more granular and precise than ever before. ",,"ByWilliam A. Haseltine, Contributor. The era of predictive genomics is rapidly reshaping how we think about disease, risk and lifelong health. Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing have equipped clinicians with insights into our bodies that are more granular and precise than ever before. With DNA and RNA sequencing, proteomics and molecular readouts, medicine now moves beyond traditional labs and imaging. It is opening a new world where the stories written in our genome help predict—and sometimes pre-empt—illness. Yet, as explored in my book, Destiny's Child No Longer, this revolution is more than just technological progress. It is a moment of great clinical and ethical consequence. It is challenging us to balance the promise of early prediction with the responsibilities that come with beginning to rewrite our genetic fate. Your genes can tell several different stories about your health. Consider the case of breast cancer. Well-studied mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 can greatly increase risk and shape screening and clinical management, but carrying these variants is not a guarantee of illness, just as their absence does not assure safety. Many people with BRCA mutations never develop cancer, while others without these mutations still may. This is because cancer and many other diseases are influenced by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Some rare genetic mutations are so powerful that they almost always cause disease if inherited. For example, Huntington’s disease is caused by a specific mutation in the HTT gene. If you have this mutation, you will almost certainly develop the disease. Similarly, certain forms of cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia are determined by having two copies of the disease-causing gene. These cases are exceptions, not the rule. Most of the time, genes act more like risk factors than guarantees. For instance, the APOE4 variant can increase the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Many people with this variant never get Alzheimer’s, and some people without it still do. Variants in the other genes can raise cholesterol and heart disease risk, but outcomes depend on many factors, including diet, exercise and other genes. These examples show that while genes can tip the scales, they rarely tell the whole story. If you have a strong genetic risk for a disease, your future isn’t set in stone. The chances of developing most conditions are shaped by a mix of your DNA, your environment, your daily habits and even a bit of luck. For example, you might inherit genes linked to heart disease, but by eating well, staying active and avoiding smoking, you can lower your risk. On the flip side, someone without those risk genes could still develop the same disease due to poor lifestyle choices or other factors. In other words, your genome is only one chapter in your health story. It’s a powerful tool. Yet, it’s not a crystal ball. Genetic test results offer insights and probabilities, not promises or guarantees. Therefore, it’s important to use them as one piece of the bigger picture when making decisions about your health. These advances force us to confront hard questions. As Destiny's Child No Longer alerts us to the power to read and rewrite genes affects more than medical outcomes. It can also impact the very fabric of family, society and policy. For every clinical success, there are stories of anxiety, financial strain and uncertainty born from ambiguous results. There are also concerns about privacy, data security and the potential misuse of information by insurers or employers. Health disparities may widen when databases remain biased toward certain ancestries. The promise of preventive care must be weighed against the risks of overdiagnosis. Policymakers, clinicians and patients alike will need to navigate these challenges as predictive genomics moves further into the mainstream. For most of us, the genomic puzzle will remain complex and evolving. The pieces shift with each new discovery. Its story will increasingly be central to how we live, care and plan for the future."
https://www.forbes.com/sites/josipamajic/2025/11/25/how-pe-and-vc-collapsed-into-one-battlefield/,How PE And VC Collapsed Into One Battlefield,"Private Equity and Venture Capital Are Now Fighting Over the Same Deals, While Second-Tier Funds Face an Existential Crisis",,"ByJosipa Majic Predin, Contributor. With IPO markets effectively frozen and AI-driven mega-rounds absorbing virtually all high-quality deal flow, private equity and venture capital have collapsed into the same battlefield, fighting over the same late-stage technology deals once clearly owned by VC. Even family offices are muscling in, writing checks once reserved for growth funds. The result is a barbell-shaped market where top-tier players crowd into a handful of oversubscribed AI and Big Tech opportunities, while second- and third-tier funds face an existential question: in a world where capital is abundant but true opportunities are scarce, what, if anything, do they actually have left to do? The IPO market, which once provided the primary exit path for venture-backed companies, remains depressed with only 81 completed IPOs through June 2024, representing just an 18% increase over the previous year. This continues a dramatic decline from 1,035 IPOs in 2021 to just 154 listings in 2023. For companies hoping to go public, the outlook remains challenging. Industry experts don't expect to see a significant upturn in activity until the latter half of 2025 or even 2026 at the earliest. According to Crunchbase analysis, many pre-IPO companies, particularly in enterprise software, are growing at slower rates than was typical during the bull market, making them less attractive candidates for public debuts. The implications are severe: profits from IPOs are one of the primary ways that VCs are able to distribute capital back to their LPs, who then reinvest that returned capital into new VC funds. With this cycle broken, the entire venture ecosystem faces a liquidity crisis. While overall funding remains constrained, artificial intelligence has created a parallel universe where capital flows freely, but only to a select few. In 2024, close to a third of all global venture funding went to companies in AI-related fields, with funding to AI companies reaching over $100 billion, up more than 80% year over year from $55.6 billion in 2023. The concentration is staggering. According to Carta's analysis, at Series C, AI companies accounted for 33% of all cash raised, and by Series E and beyond, it was 48%, meaning AI startups raised almost as much capital as all other startups combined at the latest stages. The mega-round phenomenon has intensified dramatically. In 2024, $58.3 billion, or 19% of all funding, went to billion-dollar rounds, compared with 2023, when $45.8 billion, or 15% of funding, went to rounds of a billion dollars or more. S&P Global data shows that total deal value rose 24.7% year over year to $639.02 billion in 2024, with private equity deals of at least $5 billion significantly contributing to the growth. The biggest winners include OpenAI ($157 billion valuation), Databricks ($62 billion), xAI ($50 billion), and Anthropic ($18.4 billion), with each raising multi-billion dollar rounds. Over 60% of U.S. venture funding came from rounds exceeding $100 million, according to DealRoom's analysis. The traditional boundaries between private equity and venture capital have dissolved. Buyout funds are investing earlier in the growth cycle to capture greater upside, while venture capital funds are moving into later-stage deals, structured financing, and co-investments with buyout players. Harvard Law analysis found that 2024 saw notable examples of transactions with multiple sponsors working together, with private equity firms teaming up throughout the capital stack, including through convertible or debt-like preferred shares and direct lending. Public market investors have also entered the fray. According to Resonanz Capital, firms like Tiger Global, Coatue, and D1 Capital are piling into late-stage VC deals and pre-IPO rounds because the most exciting growth stories are happening before companies go public, if they ever do. The result is intense competition for the same deals. According to Pitchbook, venture portfolios hold a total of $4.0 trillion in start-up value, more than double 2020's market value of $1.7 trillion, with exits of $500 million or more accounting for 79% of total exit value in 2024. Perhaps the most dramatic shift has been the rise of family offices as direct competitors to traditional venture capital. According to PwC, almost one-third of the total capital invested in startups worldwide came from family offices in 2022. CNBC's analysis reveals that the top 10 family offices for startup investments made over 150 investments combined in 2024, in everything from biotech and energy to crypto and artificial intelligence. According to UBS's 2024 Global Family Office report cited by GoingVC, 78% of family offices plan to invest in AI over the next 2–3 years. Family offices bring unique advantages: patient capital, operational expertise from their own businesses, and less rigid investment timelines than institutional funds. However, PwC data shows total investment activity by family offices peaked in H2 2021 at 17,460 deals and has generally trended downwards, with H1 2025 taking overall family office deal volume down to below 7,200. The democratization of startup funding is clear: in India's funding landscape, a fifth of the 1,270 total deals in 2024 were undertaken by family offices and corporate venture capital, up from 15% of 880 total deals in 2023, according to Business Standard. Despite challenging market conditions, private equity and venture capital firms are sitting on unprecedented amounts of undeployed capital. Global private equity and venture capital funds held a record $2.62 trillion of total uncommitted capital as of July 2024, with funds adding $49.44 billion to their collective cash reserves in the six months since December 2023, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The concentration is extreme. The 25 private equity and venture capital firms with the largest stores of dry powder collectively reported $556.19 billion of uncommitted capital, or more than 21% of all private equity dry powder globally. KKR & Co. topped the list with $43.86 billion available for private equity investments. This creates enormous pressure to deploy capital effectively. As Moonfare analysis notes, while offering flexibility, the sheer volume of dry powder creates pressure on GPs to deploy capital effectively and generate target returns in a competitive and potentially high-priced market environment. The problem is aging capital: funds held for four years or longer now constitute 24% of the total, up from 20% in 2022, putting increasing pressure on managers to find deals before their investment periods expire. The venture capital industry is experiencing a historic consolidation of power. According to VC Cafe's analysis, in 2024, the top 30 VC firms dominated the market, securing 75% of all U.S. venture capital fundraising, with just nine leading firms capturing half of the total raised, and Andreessen Horowitz alone raising more than 11% of all VC funds. The number of active VC firms has declined sharply. While the U.S. VC ecosystem had 3,417 VC firms by the end of 2023, the number of active venture capital firms dropped from a peak of 8,315 in 2021 to 6,175 in 2024, a reduction of over 25%, according to Finalis research. McKinsey's Global Private Markets Report found that over the past five years, the top 100 GPs made approximately three times more acquisitions of competing GPs than they did in the previous five years. Meanwhile, deal volume has collapsed to historic lows. Global venture deal volume in 2024 reached an eight-year low, with capital increasingly concentrated in late-stage rounds rather than early-stage investments. For funds outside the top tier, the outlook is grim. They face a perfect storm of challenges: Limited access to top deals: The best opportunities go to established relationships and mega-funds with deep pockets. For smaller firms with less capital to allocate and fewer human resources to deploy, every deal has to count. Valuation pressure: AI hype has driven valuations to unsustainable levels for many companies. In 2024, the median pre-money valuation on seed rounds raised by AI startups was $17.9 million, 42% higher than the median pre-money valuation among non-AI companies. Extended holding periods: With IPO markets frozen, over 30% of portfolio companies have been held for 5-plus years, an increase from approximately 22% in 2021, and private equity firms globally now hold a record 28,000 unsold companies worth more than $3 trillion, according to Chambers and Partners. LP pressure: With distributions at historic lows and capital locked up in aging portfolios, limited partners are becoming more selective about which funds receive their commitments. The barbell effect: Several AI startups raised hundreds of millions to billions in single rounds, with investors eager to back potential category leaders, creating a concentration of capital where a few high-profile players captured a disproportionate share of funding, notes The FinRate. The fundamental question facing the private equity and venture capital industries is whether this represents a temporary dislocation or a permanent structural shift. Several factors will determine the answer: Exit environment: Until IPO markets reopen or M&A activity accelerates meaningfully, the entire ecosystem remains constrained by lack of liquidity. AI sustainability: Whether current AI valuations reflect genuine value creation or speculative excess will determine how much capital ultimately finds productive deployment. Market differentiation: Funds that can demonstrate unique value, whether through operational expertise, sector specialization, or differentiated networks, may still find opportunities. Alternative structures: The rise of continuation funds, secondaries markets, and hybrid vehicles may provide new paths for both liquidity and differentiation. For now, the data tells a clear story: capital is abundant, but opportunity is scarce. The winners are those with scale, brand, and access to the handful of deals that truly matter. For everyone else, the question isn't just how to compete, it's whether competing is even possible anymore."

At just 14, Miles Wu of New York City has proven that a simple sheet of paper, if folded with mathematical precision, can hold more than 9,000 times its own weight. His passion for origami inspired him to test 54 variations of the Miura-Ori fold, in a project that earned him first place and a $25,000 grand prize at the Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge (Thermo Fisher JIC).  He hopes that these origami principles will one day contribute to designs in both temporary emergency shelters and permanent architectural structures, offering lightweight, collapsible, and remarkably strong designs for real-world use.  The national competition, run by Society for Science, reaches more than 60,000 middle school students across the United States and U.S. territories through hundreds of affiliated local science fairs, encouraging them to explore and innovate in science, technology, engineering, and math. Out of more than 2,000 top-performing applicants from 48 states, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico; just 30 finalists were selected, with Miles Wu among them, to compete in Finals Week in Washington, D.C.  “Miles’ story shows what’s possible when curiosity and character meet opportunity,” says Meron Mathias, Vice President, Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability, Thermo Fisher Scientific. “Through programs like the Thermo Fisher JIC, we’re expanding access to STEM experiences for students of all backgrounds to build a generation of innovators who will lead with creativity, compassion, and purpose.” If you are wondering what the Miura-fold is here is a quick demonstration from Miles Wu himself. Wu’s fascination with origami began at age eight, during the pandemic, when he found both solace and challenge in the precision of folding. Three years later, he attended the OrigamiUSA Annual Conference, where meeting world-class artists inspired him to see origami not just as art, but as applied science. “Origami is especially fun for me because I find ways it can overlap with my other interests, like birding, studying insects and now, science research,” he explained. Wu’s scientific influences include renowned origamist and former NASA physicist Robert J. Lang, MIT professor Erik Demaine; Cornell researcher Itai Cohen, who studies the Miura-Ori fold; and Princeton’s Glaucio H. Paulino, who teaches origami engineering. Their work guided him toward an origami-engineering fusion project, a field that blends art, geometry, and structural mechanics. Working from his family’s New York City apartment, Wu turned the living room into a makeshift lab. Between stacks of paper and sets of weights, he tested the strength of folded structures by gradually increasing loads until collapse. Though challenging, he said the process of analyzing his data was deeply rewarding. His findings were remarkable: one configuration of the Miura-Ori fold supported more than 9,000 times its own weight. Wu also discovered that shorter, tighter patterns, specifically one-inch-high folds with smaller panels, produced stronger, more stable structures than taller ones with larger panels. At the Thermo Fisher JIC, Wu competed against 29 of his peers, many of whom conducted their research in professional labs with advanced mentoring. His project, carried out entirely from home with minimal resources, stood out for its creativity, rigor, and originality. “Miles’ remarkable blend of scientific creativity, leadership and collaboration highlights the type of talent Society for Science is proud to support,” said Maya Ajmera, President & CEO, Society for Science and Executive Publisher, Science News.  Here Miles Wu talks about his project and the experience of competing. “Going into the competition, I really didn’t expect to win anything and was just happy to meet other finalists and compete in team challenges together. But it’s really been an honor to have competed among so many impressive projects,” Wu says. “This competition has taught me that I can conduct meaningful research, even as a kid with limited access and experience. It has shown me that it’s always worth following your curiosity and interests in science, because you don’t know where they could lead you.” Wu isn’t finished exploring the science of folding. He hopes to continue his research with access to advanced tools such as a hydraulic press and a computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine.  “I conducted this project entirely without access to specialized equipment,” he explained. “Having these things at my disposal would make my experimentation much more precise and efficient.” For now, Wu would like to see his winning design further developed with the help of others and applied toward applications to support people in need. “I would love to work on prototyping a temporary Miura-Ori structure that could actually be used in real-life emergencies,” he said. “It would truly be a dream for me to work with a mentor who studies origami engineering.” Outside the lab, Wu’s creativity continues to make an impact. He designs and shares his own origami creations on Instagram (@origamimilesnyc ) and previously raised $2,000 for the Wild Bird Fund by selling origami pigeons. He hopes to publish a book featuring his original designs in the future."
